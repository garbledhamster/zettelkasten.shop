xi  AUTHOR’S NOTE  During the year i wrote   this book, every day I woke up and deliberately  chose faith over fear.  I had recently come off a lucrative venture where I co-founded a cryptocur -  rency. I quit that venture in not the most pleasant fashion. My friends and  family expected me to start a newer, bigger, and better cryptocurrency. The  stage was set for me to “get back” at my old business partners who I had a  falling out with…  And there I was, assembling boxes of notecards and writing about it. There  I was, dedicating my life to a thing that flies over the heads of most people.  There was no clear path to recouping my time spent exploring the system  you’re about to learn in this book. Yet, I chose faith.   There’s something here ,  I told myself.   There’s something that is bigger than a mere box of notecards . After  reading this book, I know you’ll find this to be true.  This book is for those who value the intellectual pursuit in life. It’s for those  who wish to unlock their inner-genius so that they can contribute something  to the world. It’s for those committed to growth and learning.
12      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Thank you for joining me on this journey.  Just remember one thing—actually two: First, always choose faith over fear.  And second: always remember…to stay crispy, my friend. 1  Scott P .   Scheper  Sunday, 7:36 am  St. Thomas, Virgin Islands  1   This phrase is a funny joke I started saying when I was doing a daily podcast in early 2021.  The phrase stuck and you can find me using it in my highly entertaining emails. You can  join my email list at   https://scottscheper.com .
xiii  PREFACE (DO NOT SKIP)  The subject of this book   concerns itself with a knowledge development  system created entirely out of notecards. I call this system the Antinet  Zettelkasten (or simply, the “Antinet”).  THE TRIPLE-ENTENDRE OF THE ANTINET  The Antinet is a triple-entendre.  First off, it’s a tongue-in-cheek jab at the digitally obsessed world we live in.  There’s no debating that digital technologies have changed our world, mostly  for the better. Digital technologies are better than their analog counterparts  for many things: navigation, an open encyclopedia, information sharing, and  so on. However, the one thing I contend that digital is   not   great for is this:  thinking . Deep, deliberate thinking. Both short-term development of thought  and long-term development of thought are best procured using analog tools.  This being the case, the Antinet doesn’t mean “anti-internet.” In fact, in this  book, I introduce an   option   for using a digital reference manager. Therefore,  the Antinet is not purely analog in nature. After all, digital reference man -  agers require the internet.
xiv      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The second meaning behind the term Antinet refers to its use as an acronym.  The Antinet is an acronym that maps to four principles (detailed later on). The  four principles the acronym maps to are the same four principles employed  by Niklas Luhmann, the main originator of the Antinet. I’ll introduce you  to the acronym of the Antinet later in this book. And I’ll introduce you to  Luhmann shortly. But first, let me tell you about the third entendre.  The third meaning behind Antinet refers to Antonin Sertillanges. This Cath -  olic intellectual and writer built his own Antinet-like system and wrote about  it in his book   The Intellectual Life . I talk about Sertillanges throughout this  book. The “Ant” in Antinet also serves as an ode to Antonin.  ANTINET VS. ZETTELKASTEN  The Antinet most directly originated from the work of a German scholar  named Niklas Luhmann, a man who gained popularity for his genius-level  theoretical work in the field of sociology. Luhmann referred to his Antinet  as a   Zettelkasten , which in American English means   notebox , and in Euro -  pean English translates to   slip box . Throughout the rest of this book, I’ll use  the terms   Antinet ,   Zettelkasten ,   analog Zettelkasten , and   Luhmann ’ s notebox ,  interchangeably. And for any grammarians out there: I use the German  singular form of   Zettelkasten   as both singular and plural in English, rather  than trying to work in the German plural form of   Zettelkästen .   The Chicago  Manual of Style , on which this book’s format relies, dictates one should not  pluralize foreign words as though they were English.  I must caution you that outside of this book, the term   Zettelkasten   does not  refer to the same concept I’m referring to. When I use the term Zettelkasten,  I’m referring to the version of the Zettelkasten that Niklas Luhmann himself  used: an analog one. I am not referring to the abstracted interpretations  that the term has found itself cloaked in today. This so-called “cloaked”  version stems from the metamorphosis of a physical thinking system into  a metaphysical one. The embodiment of this new version is akin to that of  digital notetaking apps with note-linking capabilities. Such apps (which are  themselves   digital Zettelkasten   systems) merely link notes. I consider such  apps to operate in an entirely different realm altogether. Get ready to enter  the world of the Antinet. It’s a trip.
xv P REFACE   (D O   N OT   S KIP )     A NOTE ON THE SUBTITLE OF THIS BOOK  The initial subtitle for this book was,   The Secret Knowledge Development  System Evolved by History’s Greatest Minds . After I finished writing this book,  I decided to change its subtitle to the one you find on its cover:   Uncovering  the True Magic of the Notebox System That Will Turn You into a Research and  Writing Machine . I believe this new version better emphasizes two “core  aspects” of the book, which I will detail now:  The first core aspect of this book centers around   uncovering the true magic of  Niklas Luhmann’s notebox system (the Zettelkasten) . You will learn how the  modern (digital) interpretations of Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten are quite  different from its true (original) nature. These modern interpretations of  Zettelkasten lack the most important principles of the system. As a result,  the modern interpretations are   far less effective   when it comes to achieving  its main goal (genius-level creative output). 1   In this book, we will uncover  the true magic of Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten so that you can experience  its fullness (and avoid wasting your time with the modern, less-effective  digital interpretations).  The second core aspect of this book centers around directing us towards the  end goal. What is the end goal? The end goal is to become   a research and  writing machine . You see, a common misconception regarding Zettelkasten  is that it is a subfield of   Personal Knowledge Management   (“PKM”). PKM  has largely come to refer to digital notetaking apps for   storing informa -  tion . With each passing year, new digital notetaking apps emerge with  more and more features (linking notes, tagging notes, creating pre-built  templates for notes, metadata conventions for notes, etc.). The one thing  digital notetaking apps seemingly   do not   focus on is…helping you develop  knowledge! Luhmann’s sole purpose for building his Zettelkasten centered  on helping him become a research and writing machine. It was a system  that helped him   develop knowledge . It was a system that helped him   evolve  1   In fact, the modern interpretations of Zettelkasten can be even worse than ‘less effec -  tive.’ They end up being time-suck activities that revolve around linking digital files and  farting around with tags and metadata (when you should be developing knowledge). As  a result, not only are you left with ‘less effective’ creative output, you’re left with a mess  of thousands of digital notes that cause you to quit the project you set out to work on.
xvi      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  the many thoughts that emerged from his readings (over four decades).  All of this was done with a sole focus on becoming a prolific research and  writing machine (which is what he became). In brief, the true nature of  Zettelkasten is not an information storage system; it’s a   Knowledge Devel -  opment System —more specifically, it’s an   Analog Knowledge Development  system (an “AKD”). 2  Am I saying that the Zettelkasten is   only   for those interested in becoming  a research machine or a writing machine? Not quite. Even if you’re inter -  ested in becoming a reading machine (i.e., learning machine), an Antinet  Zettelkasten can help you. However, it is important to adopt the mindset  of approaching the books you read   as if   you’ll be writing a book about the  material. Paradoxically, adopting this mindset (as if you were going to   teach  the material), helps you   learn   the material. 3   In brief, by adopting the   writing  machine   mindset, you will become a better   learning machine .  After I determined this was the better subtitle, I let things sit for a week or  so. To recap, the subtitle I was left with was,   Uncovering the True Magic of  the Notebox System That Will Turn You into a Research and Writing Machine .  However, when looking at the length of the subtitle, I found it to be too  wordy. Therefore, I decided to condense it to what you find on the cover:  A Knowledge System That Will Turn You Into a Prolific Reader, Researcher and  Writer . That cuts straight to the heart of the matter (even though uncovering  the   true   nature of Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten remains a core theme of  this book).  While the new subtitle better encompasses the two core aspects of this  book, I think the very first subtitle is also worth diving into (aka, the “legacy  subtitle”). The reason why is that much of this book touches on the rich  history of the Zettelkasten. This adds important seasoning to the book.  Let’s dive into this now.  2 I hear you. The last thing the world needs right now are more acronyms, but whatever.  3 This is something we’ll discuss throughout this book. It touches on the mindset of   growth  vs. the mindset of   contribution .
xvii P REFACE   (D O   N OT   S KIP )     THE RICH HISTORY OF ZETTELKASTEN  The legacy subtitle of this book is   The Secret Knowledge Development System  Evolved by History ’ s Greatest Minds . Please take note of a few things:  First, note the phrase   History ’ s Greatest Minds . This touches on the idea  that it was not Luhmann   alone   who produced the Antinet Zettelkasten.  After all, in 1786, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach described the usage of  slip boxes ( Zettelkästchen ). 4   Indeed, some of history’s greatest minds used  systems closely resembling the Antinet. Luhmann was intimately familiar  with many of these scholars 5 . In turn, they have had a hand in evolving the  Antinet as we know it.  Those who evolved the Antinet include the following individuals: 6     Georg Philipp Harsdöffer      Georg   Wilhelm   Friedrich   Hegel     Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm      Walter Benjamin     Siegfried Kracauer      Aby Warburg     Roland Barthes      Hans Blumenberg     Reinhart Koselleck      Friedrich Kittler     Jean Paul ( Johann Paul Friedrich Richter)     Heinrich Heine      Jules Verne     Arno Schmidt      Walter Kempowski     Ernst Jünger      Michael Ende     Vladimir Nabokov      Antonin Sertillanges     Niklas Luhmann  Second, note the phrase   Evolved by . The historical genealogy of the Anti -  net was “perhaps first mentioned in 1548 by Conrad Gessner.” It was then  expanded by Georg Philipp Harsdöffer (1607–1658), Joachim Jungius  (1587–1657), and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716). The Catholic  4 Helmut Zedelmaier, Christoph Just Udenius and the German Ars Excerpendi around  1700: On the Flourishing and Disappearance of a Pedagogical Genre (Brill, 2016), 102.  5 For instance, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.  6 Markus Krajewski, Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice of a Counter Measure -   ment  against Forgetting (Brill, 2016), 324.
xviii      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  intellectual and philosopher Antonin Sertillanges outlines a similar system  to the Antinet. His book,   The Intellectual Life , published in 1921, contains the  instructions in explicit detail. 7  The Antinet was developed by the likes of many learned scholars throughout  time. Yet, the Antinet’s “non-electronic completion” is viewed by scholars  as stamped by Niklas Luhmann. 8  In the early 1950s, when Luhmann began building his Zettelkasten, he was  working at the Lüneburg Higher Administrative Court. It was there that  he spent his time “organizing a reference system for administrative court  decisions.” 9   When asked by an interviewer what he did after getting off  work at five o’clock in the evening, Luhmann replied that he read a lot and,  “above all I started to work with a Zettelkasten.” 10   From this, one infers that  whatever Luhmann learned while organizing the reference system for the  Lüneburg Higher Administrative Court ended up helping him   evolve   the  Zettelkasten into what it is today.  For this reason, the Antinet is not   a secret knowledge development system  created by one individual ; rather, it’s   a secret knowledge development sys -  tem evolved by history ’ s greatest minds . The overhyped digital notetaking  systems of today have rendered the old way of developing knowledge  almost completely lost. Analog knowledge development has become a  secret. Its methods are a secret known only to a small collection of peo -  ple. For instance, scholars who study the evolution of notetaking in Early  Modern Europe. 11   Even though the legacy subtitle is admittedly sensationalistic,  I hold that there is at least sensational substance to support its sensationalism.  7 OP A.

xix P REFACE   (D O   N OT   S KIP )     In summary, you can see by the depth of both subtitles how robust this  book is. It touches on many aspects of the Zettelkasten: its true nature, its  modern misconceptions, its key principles, its history, its magic, its scientific  underpinnings, and more. This additional context gives you a greater respect  for the journey you’re about to embark on in reading this book. But before  you do, let’s talk about the goal of this book.  THE GOAL OF THIS BOOK  The goal of this book is both simple   and   complex. My goal is to help people  who are committed to growth and learning to create genius-level work.  I hope the genius-level work created lasts for two hundred years or more.  The reason any piece of work might last for two hundred years or more is  related to the contribution it makes to other people.  That is my   why .  My   what   is this system: the Antinet. The Antinet is a   knowledge development  system . It’s a tool that enables one to develop   thoughts . I also contend that  it develops thoughts better than its digital imitators. The Antinet enables  one to unlock brilliant insights. It’s built on fundamental principles that help  develop one’s mind. It’s built on both order and chaos. In turn, it reveals  accidental associations and unconventional interactions between ideas.  There are other properties of the system I will introduce in the book as well.  My   how   is the way that I preach this system. Spoiler alert: I’m not an academic.  I couldn’t care less about ascribing to academic conventions (i.e., aca -  demic jargon).  Anyway, I intend to write using my own voice. I intend to speak in a way  that discusses complex ideas in an as simple manner as possible, without  being simplistic. That is   how   I intend to deliver the message of the Antinet  Zettelkasten to you.  My   why , my   what   and my   how   are both simple   and   complex. An Antinet is a  system founded on simple laws yet morphs into something quite complex.
xx      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The theory behind why it works is also simple yet has very deep implications  in the field of knowledge. Get ready for a fun ride.  THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL OF THIS TEXT  This book is intended for the general reader; however, it is not trivial. It’s quite  challenging in parts and quite theoretical in parts. In summation, it’s just as  theoretical as it is practical, yet its theoretical contents contain practical impli -  cations that cannot be reproduced by a mere “how-to guide” on this subject.  By becoming acquainted with the theoretical depth of the Antinet, you will  come away with a richer understanding of a system that, upon first glance, seems  rather simple. After reading this book, you will have a fuller understanding of  the system and the deep-rooted rationale for its structure. As a result, I believe  you will have a higher likelihood of sticking with the system in the long term.  THIS PROBABLY WILL NOT BE THE LAST  TIME YOU READ THIS BOOK  While writing this book, I began uploading YouTube videos demonstrating  how an Antinet works. As a result, I began receiving feedback, questions,  and comments. One comment, in particular, stuck out to me. It was from  an Antinetter named Kathleen, who specializes in the field of linguistics.  In a comment on one of my videos, Kathleen wrote:  “I just watched this again and finally, this being my third time  through this particular video, it made sense from start to fin -  ish. I don’t envy the challenge you have taken on to describe  this system. It’s so nebulous until you have the cards in front  of you… The video hasn’t changed, but this time through it  was a totally different video for me. How will you convey to  your readers that they might have to spiral back to chapters  previously covered once they start getting an inkling of what’s  going on with an Antinet?”  The answer to that question is simple: you will likely need to revisit this book  and review it after you have some experience building an Antinet. However,  don’t let this fact stop you from proceeding. If you value developing your
xxi P REFACE   (D O   N OT   S KIP )     mind, developing your thoughts, and creating genius-level work, under -  standing and building an Antinet is worth it.  The fact that you may need to revisit this book regularly through the years is  a good thing. It means the content is important enough to actually revisit!  I have several books that I keep on my shelf in my office. They’re staring at  me right now from across the room as I write this. I revisit them from time  to time, and I keep them on my shelf to remind me that I ought to reread  them if I encounter a lull in my work.  In summary, you must be prepared to do two things when engaging this  book: (1) actively apply the knowledge and techniques (as Kathleen has),  and (2) revisit the information at various stages in your journey.  A NOTE ON HOW TO READ THIS BOOK  A curious thing happens when one develops knowledge using the techniques  you’re about to learn. In-depth context often accompanies each thought.  Other thoughts oftentimes inspire each paragraph. These inspired thoughts  can derive from your thoughts, or these inspired thoughts can come from  others’ thoughts. As a result, paragraphs and sentences end up so deep that  one’s writing begins to reflect this. It reflects this in the form of footnotes.  I have written this book using my own Antinet. As such, I have been quite  judicious in attaching comments and sources in the form of footnotes. This  text is ripe with footnotes. My recommendation is to read the book once  without worrying about the footnotes.  Do not get stuck on the idea that you must read every single footnote. If a  sentence with a footnote truly sparks your curiosity, certainly feel free to  read the footnote. Otherwise, do not get bogged down.  ADVICE FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO USE  THEIR OWN ANTINET WHILE READING  THIS BOOK  If you want to use (and build out) your own Antinet while reading this book,  then pay attention: do not read this book linearly.
xxii      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Here’s what you should do: First, read   Chapter 11: The Hitchhiker ’ s Guide  to the Antinet . This chapter will give you a good base version for your own  Antinet. Follow the instructions in detail.  Second, within   Chapter 14: Extraction , there’s a section titled   The 2-Step  Luhmannian Bibcard Method . Read this section. Then, while reading this book,  use a bibcard and create brief   bib notes . You can use multiple bibcards (you  don’t need to fit all your bib notes from this book onto one bibcard). After you  read that section, you’ll understand what bibcards are and what bib notes are.  Last, if you’re ever confused about a term, you’ll find a helpful   Glossary   in  the back of the book.  After you complete the steps outlined, you can begin reading this book,  starting from   Chapter 1   and proceeding linearly.  A FINAL PIECE OF ADVICE  With this book, you have stumbled upon something special. It’s unique,  quirky, and—dammit—it’s downright crazy! You are embarking on a journey  in learning the old way to develop knowledge. With the recent over-hyped  popularity of digital tools,   the old way   of developing knowledge has become  the secret way . This revolves around using just your brain, pen, and paper.  I contend this secret way is the best way.  The greatest thinkers and writers of all time did not need a computer to  develop genius-level work, and neither do you. I’m going to show you how  to start thinking again, using a pen, notecards, and…your brain! Get ready  for the ride of your intellectual life.

Look  at me ,   I ’ m a single 34-year-old with nothing to live for besides my cat   (a ragdoll  named Brodus Maximus). I felt like a complete slouch, a freaking loser.  I was empty and unfulfilled.  Roughly a year prior, I had left the cryptocurrency company I had co-founded.  For two years, I worked eight days a week to launch the company. In record-  breaking time, I helped take the company from $2.14 million in debt to be -  coming one of the most exciting high-growth companies out there. 1   We raised  roughly $10 million via what is known as an ICO (Initial Coin Offering).

We then held an exciting conference in downtown San Diego, and I spoke  to over a thousand excited investors and customers who were diehard fans.  Over the next year, however, the market proceeded down a slow death march.  Cryptocurrency prices across the entire industry dropped significantly.  My investment and investments made by my family and friends who trusted  me were down over 95%. The thousands of customers and investors who  had once declared their love for the company were disgruntled. They were  now practically threatening to bring pitchforks to our offices!  Since I was the face of the company, I took the brunt of it. It felt awful; I was  called a scammer and every other awful thing you can think of. Things got  even worse. We had to lay off almost half our company in a day (totaling  over forty people). 3  On the day of the layoff, I observed my relationships with now-former  employees transform from some of my closest to my most contentious ones.  I felt depleted, yet I couldn’t show it because I still needed to lead the rest  of the team out of the mess. I pressed on for another six months. When we  got the company to a stable point, I knew deep down that I needed to take  a break, and I had to step away for personal reasons. I was empty inside.  On top of this, the technology really hadn’t panned out; it needed more  time to develop. Meanwhile, the vision was redirected into something  I wasn’t proud of. Yet, because I was not the majority partner or shareholder,  I didn’t have the legal control required to do anything about it. Nor did  I possess the energy to fight it. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally  burnt out.  Fast-forward a year later, and there I was, on my couch, lying down in a  vegetative coma of indolence, watching   Billions . I wasn’t necessarily suicidal,  3 “San   Diego   Blockchain   Startup   XY   Lays   off   40   People,   Losing   Half   Its   Staff,”  San Diego Union-Tribune, June 4, 2019, https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/busi -  ness/technology/story/2019-06-04san-diego-blockchain-startup-xy-lays-off-40-peo -  ple-losing-half-its-staff.

Plus, on top of  this, my other ragdoll cat, Mr. Bigglesworth (Brodus’s brother), passed away  from stomach cancer. He was only two years old. After watching him suffer  for months, I decided to pull the plug. It may seem ridiculous writing about  this; there are definitely more severe travesties in life. But I was single at the  time, with only two cats for company. Yet there I found myself, holding one  of them in my arms as the veterinarian injected him with something to make  his breathing stop forever.  I was depressed; I came down with a major case of black ass, as Samuel  Johnson would call it (his phrase for melancholy). On the surface, I wished  to create even more significant success than what I had engineered at the  cryptocurrency company. This time, however, I wanted more control over  the product and the company’s direction so that, in my mind, we wouldn’t  compromise on the vision.  Yet what I really desired was to serve people worth serving. Sure, there were  some excellent people I got to serve at the cryptocurrency company; but,  let’s face it, the vast majority of those involved were in it to make money  without having to do anything. The people interested in cryptocurrency were  there for one thing, and one thing only: to get rich doing nothing. When the  market is up, you’re Jesus Christ himself; when the market is down, you’re  the reason for all their problems.  I would rather not serve people who were   get - rich - quickers , and I wanted to  avoid being in the business of wasting my energy with wasteful products.  Sure, I wanted to have a significant impact, but I also wanted to provide a  product that actually leaves future generations with something useful.  After finishing the entire season of   Billions , I decided to sell my 72-inch big  screen TV and spend time brainstorming my next venture. I was still fas -  cinated with cryptocurrency, and I was intrigued by decentralized finance.  I saw innovation coming out of that space. But I was leaning toward creat -  ing something in my craft of marketing and copywriting. Specifically, I was  intrigued by the idea of creating a newsletter, and it would be in a format  inspired by my mentor, the late, great copywriter Gary Halbert. I began
26      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  to grow inspired by the idea of creating a newsletter related to marketing,  copywriting, cryptocurrency, and whatever else I was interested in.  In this state, I began to form a habit. For the next several months, I would sit  on my patio in the sun, smoking cigars and reading. I ended up smoking far  too many cigars. I got up to four per day, and it was so bad my lymph nodes  kept flaring up, screaming at me to quit (which I finally did).  Anyway, I began to read all day on my patio. I read psychology and philosophy  books. I would sit there in the sun and shade, take a few puffs of a cigar, read,  and then use a commonplace book to take notes. I had used a commonplace  book in the past to store notes, but I ran into limitations. After a few days,  I was reminded of those limitations.  I also had used notecards in the past. I began writing notes on notecards  roughly fifteen years prior, and I had been pretty consistent at taking notes  for books using 3 x 5 inch notecards. Yet, these notes had become numerous  and unruly because they were organized in “silos.” Each concept on the card  was difficult to find because they were clustered by the title of the book.  Nevertheless, even with these limitations, I inexplicably found notecards  to be the best tool for learning and retaining information.  Yet, using notecards proved difficult. I was on the patio smoking cigars in  the sun during this time. It was hard enough to read a book with the wind  constantly blowing, flipping the pages. Using notecards was even more  annoying, and they flew everywhere. For this reason, I stuck with using a  commonplace book.  The problem I was running into with the commonplace book was that the  silos of information I was creating were disconnected. I read books and then  wrote my thoughts out and came up with great ideas; however, the thoughts  were not connected. It was turning into a swamp of excellent knowledge,  turned mucky because it wasn’t connected to a source of clean water.  If I read something new that would develop and evolve a previous concept,  my previous ideas would remain locked inside a random page in the middle
27 T HE   J OURNEY   T HAT   L ED   M E   TO   P UBLISH   A   B OOK   ON   THE   A NTINET     of my commonplace book, requiring that I dig around to find it (or otherwise  forget it). The idea would become stale and disconnected.  Yet, while reading, I felt there was an incommunicable power in taking  notes by hand—whether that be in my commonplace book or on notecards.  Writing things down by hand developed my understanding of what I was  reading. It increased my retention of the concepts I wrote down and evolved  my thinking. It helped me form new ideas in a way that was far better than  typing notes into my laptop. Plus, a laptop workflow doesn’t work so well  when you read in the sun while smoking cigars. It gets hot and ashy and  dirty. And then there’s the glare factor.  I was aiming to begin organizing my thoughts and knowledge to turn them  into something that helped me create my next venture. I felt the urge to  connect my ideas as I spotted many patterns in my readings. These were  patterns across the disciplinary fields of psychology, philosophy, and mar -  keting. At this point, I turned to a surprising tool that, in retrospect, yielded  some surprisingly good results. I started using Microsoft Excel to link my  ideas. I also used it to diagram concepts and connections between them.  It proved handy in organizing information at a high level.  Over the years, I have tried out every tool you can think of. This includes  notetaking apps like Evernote, mind-mapping software, the reMarkable Tab -  let, and many other tools. The closest tool I found for helping me organize  my knowledge was Trello. Yet, even Trello was lacking compared to good  ol’ Microsoft Excel.  Several months went by, and I continued along in this way, settling for a  mishmash workflow: using my commonplace book, Microsoft Excel, and  sometimes notecards.  One morning, I woke up and did what I usually did—I checked a website  called   Hacker News . 4   This site serves as a hub of user-submitted stories,  in which the best ones get upvoted. That morning, at the top of the page,  4 https://news.ycombinator.com
28      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  was a submission titled, “Foam: A personal knowledge management and  sharing system for VSCode.” I clicked on the link and began exploring.  I learned that Foam was a “personal knowledge management sharing sys -  tem,” and it was for “organizing your research, [and] keeping re-discov -  erable notes.” 5   I learned that all of this is just a fancy way of saying it’s an  application for creating markdown files and linking to other markdown  files within the text of the notes. This is done by using two square brackets  in a method known as   wikilinks , for instance:   [[Example Link to  Some Note]] .  I also learned from Foam’s website that it was based on something called  Roam Research (“Roam”). Yet unlike Roam, and unlike something called  “Zettelkasten,” one could “use Foam without joining a cult.” 6  I had no idea what Roam or Zettelkasten was, nor did I care. I had enough  on my plate (like trying to figure out what to do with my life). Plus, the idea  of joining a cult didn’t sound appealing. And after Googling “Zettelkasten”  and coming across the website zettelkasten.de, I found the content way  over my head. With that, I continued experimenting with Foam without  bothering to understand all the other stuff.  After downloading Foam, I recall picking it up quickly. The lightbulb went  on in my mind. It became clear how novel it was to create notes and then  link them together. My enthusiasm continued to grow when Foam presented  me with a nifty-looking bubble graph showing how my notes connected to  one another. I was blown away.   It was official , I thought to myself,   I ’ ve entered  the Matrix ,   and there ’ s no going back .  At this point, I ditched the mashup of my commonplace book, Excel, and  notecards. I was convinced I had discovered the new and better world of  linked notes.  5 “Foam,” Foam, accessed February 10, 2022, https://foambubble.github.io/foam/.  6 “Principles,” Foam, accessed August 27, 2021, https://foambubble.github.io/foam/prin -  ciples.html.
29 T HE   J OURNEY   T HAT   L ED   M E   TO   P UBLISH   A   B OOK   ON   THE   A NTINET     After a short stint using Foam, I stumbled across a similar tool called  Obsidian . After using Obsidian for a brief time, it became apparent that this  tool was better than Foam. It was slick and packed with more features. For  me, the killer feature was its ability to dynamically update all links. With  this feature, if you changed the filename of a note, the other links pointing  to the file wouldn’t break.  I found myself so enthusiastic about Obsidian that I would spend my evenings  watching YouTube videos on its best practices. In doing this, I came across  a particular YouTube channel with professional, well-produced videos. Its  creator was a sharp guy in his mid-to-late twenties who spoke clearly. After  watching a series of these videos, I learned that he had created a six-week-  long online course purporting to teach his methods.  I signed up for the course’s most premium package: $1,322 for a six-week  course with a 90-minute one-on-one session with its creator. I spent the  next six weeks learning the principles. Not only that, but I learned things like  how one should   not   copy-and-paste things into notes. I learned that folders  were “rigid” and “bad.” I learned that one should instead embrace tags and  create files that act as a “map of content” for notes. I learned more advanced  things like the concept of workflows and using templates for creating new  notes. I began exploring all the plugins Obsidian came with and I installed  new community plugins and began enhancing my Obsidian editor’s color  scheme and layout. I continued to learn the ins and outs of notetaking best  practices. I learned about the concept of taking something called “atomic  notes” and laboriously breaking apart my monolithic notes into individual  components. I learned about setting up different hotkeys and macros to  speed up my “notemaking” process.  After several months, I became a pretty advanced user of Obsidian. I had  custom commands and macros that were fed inputs and spat out nicely  formatted starter templates for my notes. I used these features extensively.  I had dozens of hotkeys I would use for various things to save time. I became  what I now call a “hotkey junkie.”  Nevertheless, discouraging thoughts would arise in my mind now and then.
30      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The thoughts revolved around the fear that all I was really doing was busy  work. Deep down, I felt like I was just majoring in the minor. “Never mistake  activity for achievement,” as John Wooden would say.  At this point, I was looking at a folder size of 105 MB, with 1,272 items in it.  Almost all the files were notes, though there were a few images and tem -  plate files. After this much work, I imagined I would feel more tranquil and  organized—or at the very least, closer to what I was trying to accomplish.  I had set out to use Obsidian to map out all the concepts from the books  I was reading. My goal was to organize them into a cohesive whole that would  become greater than the sum of its parts. I hoped to use the concepts to  produce a book or a newsletter on marketing, copywriting, and cryptocur -  rency. Yet, I had ended up with what amounted to a rat’s nest of 1,272 linked  files, and a nifty diagram presenting me with a bubble graph of the mess!  I felt hopeless, and like I had ventured further away from making sense of  my readings. Even the mishmash of my commonplace book and Excel felt  more helpful than the mess I had created with Obsidian.  At this point, a book showed up in the mail. I had heard about the book in the  online course I had taken. The book,   How to Take Smart Notes , was written  by an academic named Sönke Ahrens. I began reading the book and soon  encountered the same term, which I recall coming across on Foam’s website,  where it had been implied that this term had a cultish following—the term  was   Zettelkasten .  Yet as I read the book   How to Take Smart Notes   and learned more about  Zettelkasten   and its creator, Niklas Luhmann, I started to gain a clearer  understanding of what it was actually all about.  Ahrens provided more explicit detail on how a Zettelkasten worked compared  with what I had found researching online. In addition, Ahrens explained  how an analog Zettelkasten worked. Although it provided a very sparse  description, it was the only description I had come across that explained  how an analog Zettelkasten works.
31 T HE   J OURNEY   T HAT   L ED   M E   TO   P UBLISH   A   B OOK   ON   THE   A NTINET     Oddly, however, Ahrens seemed less interested in the functions of the  analog Zettelkasten. Instead, he spent most of his time preaching that  Luhmann’s system could be refitted for the digital age by using digital apps  possessing note-linking capabilities. In this spirit, Ahrens seemed to invent  new concepts for doing this, coining terms like   fleeting notes ,   literature notes  and   permanent notes .  Although Ahrens’s notion sounded intriguing, from my previous experiences,  it created a digital mess. Instead, I decided to give the analog version—the  original version—a good solid try first.  As soon as I began using the Zettelkasten in analog form, I recall saying to  myself, “ Ahhh … so this is how all this stuff is supposed to work! ” I remember  thinking how different it was compared to the digital apps I had used—and  how much better the analog version was! The next day, I wrote by hand for  nearly twelve hours straight. I wanted to stop, but simply couldn’t. I had so  many ideas I felt needed to be developed. In the previous months, I had  spent most of my energy linking notes, formatting them, and making them  “atomic.” Now my thoughts were pouring out. I remember writing so much  that a callous formed on my index finger. Thoughts were being developed  on paper and flowing from my mind. Yet, I could actually see myself using  the knowledge and internally developing it over the long term. This expe -  rience was exciting.  Yet, Ahrens’s description of how an analog Zettelkasten worked was rather  wanting. It was missing a ton of detail and was vaguely outlined in several  paragraphs. 7   But to Ahrens’s credit, his vague description was perhaps the  best out there of how an analog Zettelkasten worked. To compensate for the  vagueness of Ahrens’s description, I began researching online. Soon, I came  across something fascinating: a special project had commenced at Bielefeld  University in Germany, the same university where Luhmann was tenured.  7   Sönke Ahrens,   How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing,  Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers  (North Charleston, SC: CreateSpace, 2017), 18-20.
32      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The project entailed digitizing Luhmann’s entire Zettelkasten (roughly ninety  thousand notecards) and uploading it online for all to view. 8  I began to scan Luhmann’s Online Archive and even started writing out  the translated versions of his notes by hand. Using Luhmann’s actual  Zettelkasten as a guide, I began building out my analog Zettelkasten over  the following months.  I also began porting over the notecards I had taken for the previous fifteen  years. I had been building out a notecard box off and on over the previous  fifteen years. These cards were not addressed, but just free-floating notecards.  The thing I was missing was the infinite internal branching brought forth by  the Antinet’s tree structure.  I started installing the old cards into my analog Zettelkasten by giving them  numeric-alpha addresses in the top-right corner, and then branching them  with similar cards. I began to observe how the notecards I had created for  over a decade began to reveal patterns I would have otherwise not seen if  they’d remained organized by book title. It was very exciting to observe the  power of such a system.  The experience and the journey I went through helped me realize that the  magic of a Zettelkasten—and indeed the magic of knowledge management—  rests not in the idea of creating notes; just as important is the medium one  uses to create the notes. The magic of Zettelkasten does not come from  taking atomic notes and linking them together using sexy software. Rather,  the magic rests in the analog thinking system Luhmann created. One built  of a pen, paper, and…a brain.  Over the following months, I began to see some encouraging results using  the analog Zettelkasten. From studying Luhmann’s archives, I discovered  there were four key principles that serve as the foundation of Luhmann’s  8   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolu -  tion in Early Modern Europe 53 (2016), 292.
33 T HE   J OURNEY   T HAT   L ED   M E   TO   P UBLISH   A   B OOK   ON   THE   A NTINET     system. These four principles comprise the acronym “ANTI.” From there  on, I began using the term “Antinet” to describe the system.  Meanwhile, I was progressing on the project related to marketing, copywrit -  ing, and cryptocurrency. I began to see my knowledge compounding, and  this helped me produce content.  I was gaining a ton of momentum and making progress. I also began using  an analog weekly planner to manage my to-do’s and my goals. I found my  productivity skyrocketing during this period. These practices also helped  me detach myself from the digital distractions brought forth by phone  and laptop.  More importantly, my mind felt like it was actually being stretched, and like  it was growing again. If I’m not learning and growing, I’m not the happiest  person to be around. This system started bringing me happiness and joy again.  I’ve since introduced the magic of the Antinet to my Little Brother, who I  mentor (initially, we met through the Big Brothers Big Sisters mentorship  program, and I’ve continued mentoring him beyond). I’ve seen him go  from starting fights in clubs to literally bring his Antinet into the library and  growing his mind all day. He reads and develops his notes from his readings  well past the time the sun goes down. He’s learning copywriting and market -  ing with my help. He’ll also soon be the first in his family to graduate from  college. Like me, he has named his Antinet (he named his “Huncho”; mine  is named “Stewie”), in recognition of what Luhmann himself described as  the magic of the Antinet: it functions as “an alter ego with whom we can  constantly communicate.” 9  After discovering the power of the analog Zettelkasten (aka, the Antinet),  I began sharing my material online with people. I’ve met some incredible  people through my website, and through Reddit, YouTube, and Twitter. I’ve  started to see the transformation of others who use analog thinking systems.  9 Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

34      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  There are some fascinating people out there who are having success with  this tool. For instance, Stephanie Williams uses an Antinet to teach her deaf  son, who has a unique learning style. 10  The Antinet helped me achieve what I was missing—a system that possessed  the power of thinking on paper. It helped me retain the power of writing  by hand without it turning into a disconnected knowledge swamp (which  is what commonplace books create). It helped me to finally make some  progress in my projects and develop them to fruition.  Yet something odd happened early on in my project related to marketing,  copywriting, and cryptocurrency. It fell to the wayside because I felt this  compelling desire to share the power of the Antinet. After all, I had to dis -  cover the system the hard way, and I knew others would have to go through  the same slog I experienced to discover the true power of the Zettelkasten  (in all its analog glory). At this point, I stopped and listened to my heart,  not my head. If I had learned anything from my previous cryptocurrency  experience, true fulfillment comes not from chasing money but from gen -  uinely creating a product one can be proud of. Sure, there’s more money  in creating a newsletter or book that provides money-making insights for  entrepreneurs, marketers, and crypto speculators. Yet, in my heart, I felt  less passionate about doing such a thing and more compelled to explore the  seemingly absurd idea of teaching people about an analog thinking system.  Let’s be clear, getting passionate about an analog Zettelkasten is quite  absurd. It’s a seemingly outdated system of notecards devised by some dead  academic whose books are nearly impossible to read! Yet I couldn’t resist.  I felt drawn to sharing what I had discovered. I remembered the fascinat -  ing people I interacted with in the online course I had taken on Obsidian.  I weighed these feelings and then decided.

That is,  I decided to spend a year of my life reading and writing all day about an  analog notebox system—the Antinet. I’ve worked on this book like a dog;  however, I’ve done so without burning myself out.  I am energized writing about something that I know can help driven people,  academics, and knowledge workers develop their minds. It hasn’t been easy.  I’ve been living off my investments and savings, without making a penny  off this work. But I don’t care; I sleep soundly at night knowing I haven’t  sold my soul, or wasted people’s lives with wasteful, speculative products  that bilk other people out of money. Somehow I ended up doing what I  wanted to do all along—and I found it in quite an odd vehicle. I decided  to do something that was missing in my previous ventures, and that is this:  helping people worth helping.  It’s an honor for me to serve you and help you read more effectively, take  useful notes from readings, and transform them into powerful long-term  material that makes an impact in your field.

36  C H A PT E R T WO  �  THE WHO AND WHY  OF THE ANTINET  I n the early days of writing   this book, I recorded a podcast every day. 1  In the podcast, I mainly discussed items related to what I was discovering  about the Antinet.  One day, my father, who has served his community as a mortgage broker for  over thirty-five years, visited me in San Diego, California. I learned that he  had listened to a lengthy episode about the Antinet recorded the previous  day. Yet instead of feeling grateful, I felt a bit uneasy. This prompted me to  clarify who should bother investing their finite life energy into learning  about the Antinet. Sure, my dad probably listened to the podcast because  he loves me. But should he really invest his time learning about the Antinet?  Attention   is the most valuable asset you have. You must not waste it learning  something that you really shouldn’t bother with. I love my dad and would  hate to think he’d waste his time learning about the Antinet when he really  should be spending it on his craft. Even though I don’t know you, I’d hate  for you to waste your time as well. For this reason, before you even begin  getting too deep into this book, I would like to provide some context and  reasons for why you should or shouldn’t read this book.  1   I have since discontinued the podcast, yet I continue to publish a piece of content every  day as part of a deliberate commitment.

Luhmann  himself held that the Antinet was a “universal tool.” A tool that could capture  any thought and potentially provide value to anyone, as long the thought  could be written on a notecard. 3  Although Luhmann held that one “can place almost everything in [the  notebox],” so long as it can be “noted down,” I hold a closer view to that of  several scholars, that an Antinet is primarily beneficial for researchers and  2   According to Yuval Noah Harari, a bestselling author, and profoundly independent  thinker, “We need to know ourselves better and we need to develop this mental flexi -  bility.

The Antinet develops thoughts both in the short term  and long term. Thoughts serve as the raw material for non-fiction writers,  and thoughts stand as the raw material for the Antinet.  The purpose of the Antinet is to develop your thoughts so that they are  more thoroughly evolved and supported by the time they make their way  to your manuscript.  The Antinet is primarily a tool for researchers and writers. However, do note  the use of the term   primarily . The Antinet is   primarily   useful for non-fiction  writers; yet, it’s not   exclusively   useful for such individuals.  A MORE PESSIMISTIC ANSWER  A pessimistic answer to the question of who should bother learning the  Antinet is this: most people shouldn’t bother with this book.  Here’s why—there are 1.65 million writers in the world. 5   There are at least  7.8 million researchers in the world. 6   For good measure, let’s throw in an  extra twenty million more individuals who are aspiring writers, professional  researchers, graduate students, and independent intellectuals. That’s 29.45  million people. Divide that into 7.9 billion people on earth, and you get  0.37%. In other words, there’s a 0.37% chance that an Antinet is helpful for  any given person. Therefore, there’s only a small chance that you should  bother with this book. However, you’re not an average person. Being that  you found yourself here and are reading this right now, perhaps I’ve already  filtered out the other 99.63% of people. And, in that case, I’m honored to  have you here!  4 Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes.” “The slip box becomes a universal instru -  ment.

39 T HE   W HO   AND   W HY   OF   THE   A NTINET     A MORE OPTIMISTIC ANSWER TO WHO SHOULD  EVEN BOTHER WITH LEARNING ABOUT THE  ANTINET  The Antinet is a system that serves as a   ruminant   for your thoughts. The idea  that only non-fiction writers can benefit from such a system is somewhat  limiting and probably inaccurate. Indeed, mathematicians who construct  proofs that require rumination over months (or perhaps years) would most  certainly find value in a system such as an Antinet.  Richard Feynman and many physicists would find their success watered  down if it were not for their analog devices that serve as a form of short-term  thought development and long-term rumination.  It appears that non-fiction writers and deep researchers are   primarily   those  who will benefit from thinking systems such as an Antinet.  If you’re an entrepreneur, an artist, a software engineer, a business profes -  sional, etc., here’s the cold hard truth: an Antinet will likely be less helpful  to you—unless you intend to publish and ship content. This goes for any  Zettelkasten system (even the digital knockoffs).  Regardless of what camp you fall into, there’s one thing you cannot forego.  And that is, a commitment over the long term to developing your knowledge  using an Antinet. Think decades, not years.  WHY NOTETAKING IS IMPORTANT TO  LEARN IN THE FIRST PLACE  It’s been put forth by scholars that “reading without noting” yields “superficial  knowledge.” This is because reading, as an act alone, is “not accompanied by  the attention and thought required to make a well-considered note.” 7  Notetaking serves as the mechanism that enables a contradictory paradox.  One initially considers notetaking to be a   memory replacement tool . That is,  7 Richard Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices . (Brill, 2016), 138.
40      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  you don’t have to memorize anything because you can just dump it all in  an archive of notes; in other words, you can replace the need to memorize.  However, something else occurs entirely. Notetaking, if done via writing by  hand, acts as a   memory enhancement tool .  Notetaking was thought to aid memory in two different ways, observes Ann  Blair in her work on the subject. First, it creates a written record to return to.  Second, and more interestingly, by forcing the mind to dwell on the material,  the act of writing excerpts and the thoughts they generate enables one to  retain better what was read or heard. 8  Jeremias Drexel (1581—1638) observes that if one takes notes, their memory  becomes far from being neglected; in fact, their memory becomes “substantially  more effective.” As the scholar Alberto Cevolini reflects, notetaking promotes  better   understanding   of material. The reason why centers around the time and  attention devoted to the reading. “The reader,” observes Cevolini, “reflects lon -  ger on what he is reading, and the matter becomes more clearly understood.” 9  In addition, notetaking procures long-term knowledge storage by setting up  the required material for   maintenance rehearsal   and   elaborative rehearsal —  critical components of human memory that will be covered later in the book.  Simply stated, if developing deep, long-term   non-superficial knowledge   from  the books you read is of essential value to you, then notetaking is the most  critical skill you must master.  WHY A NOTETAKING SYSTEM  IS IMPORTANT  One reason to build a notetaking system centers on the simple idea that one  should follow in the footsteps of history’s greatest scholars and thinkers:  “In light of [notetaking’s] (literally) rich tradition, one would be well-advised  8 Ann Blair,   Early Modern Attitudes toward the Delegation of Copying and Note-Taking   ( Brill,  2016 ),   276.  9 Alberto Cevolini, Storing Expansions: Openness and Closure in Secondary Memories  (Brill, 2016), 168.
41 T HE   W HO   AND   W HY   OF   THE   A NTINET     to mind the recommendations of the scholars, and set about the construction  of [a notetaking system] as soon as possible.” 10  Another reason is that a notetaking system allows one to offload the cog -  nitive processing work that memory requires for later recall. Cognitive  processing can then be used to think, develop, and reflect on ideas instead  of developing mnemonic memorization tricks, such as the method of loci  used by ancient Greek thinkers.  Yet, as previously touched upon, a notetaking system is primarily best suited  for writers and researchers who “ingest” and produce much content. Scholars  agree that a notetaking system is a valuable tool for those who mainly wish  to “work with information gleaned from reading.” 11  WHY USE AN ANTINET  An Antinet is a strict interpretation of the already niche field of Zettelkasten,  which many believe to exist within the niche field of personal knowledge  management (PKM). 12   PKM is a niche field within knowledge management,  which stands already as a rather niche field itself. In brief, the Antinet is  believed to reside in the deep alcoves of an already very niche field.  Chances are, you’re a nerd like me who geeks out over learning, growth,  reading, and the development of your mind. If that’s not you, then you’re  in the wrong place. If this describes you, then carry on reading.  The question then becomes,   why should you invest your time learning about  the Antinet in the first place?  There are several reasons, which I’ll outline throughout the book; how -  ever, the short answer is this: it’s the purest, hardest, most-time-intensive,  10 Markus Krajewski,   Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice of a Counter-Measurement  against Forgetting   (Brill, 2016),   322.  11 Krajewski,   Note-Keeping , 312.  12 This is a common misconception. In reality, Zettelkasten does not fall under the field of  PKM. The   true   nature of Zettelkasten revolves around   knowledge development . It does not  revolve around storing and managing   information   (which is what PKM is really about).
42      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  but most rewarding way to develop your knowledge. Digital apps and  other new tools cut corners that produce stunted thoughts. Life’s too short.  If you’re going to produce work, do it the hard way. The result will show  signs of your commitment to this.  The Antinet is for those who aim to produce thought-provoking content,  even if it’s at the expense of being easy. Digital tools, I contend, are easier  and more convenient than building an analog knowledge system; however,  the output digital systems produce is of lesser quality than systems that  force one to   think on paper .  THE ANTINET EVOLVES YOUR MIND  Another reason one ought to adopt and learn the Antinet centers around  evolution . If you wish to evolve as a person and evolve your mind, an Antinet  is the most full-bodied tool for doing such.  Akin to the concept of human evolution happening by way of   externalization  (i.e., creating tools like axes, spears, vehicles for transport), a theory “that was  very successful in the second half of the twentieth century states that evolution  implies an increasing ‘exteriorization’ of individual memories.” 13   This means  that to evolve, we must externalize our memories and move from the structural  coupling of   communication from consciousness   to   communication with machines .  Yet, there’s a problem with this evolutionary leap. The issue is that when one  moves toward communication with machines (such as using digital notes to  interact with one’s own internally-sourced thoughts), one’s consciousness  becomes watered down and stripped of its individualism.  The Antinet Preserves One’s Consciousness Better  Than Digital Tools Because of Its Analog Nature  Your handwriting is a mighty powerful thing. Something covered later in  13 Cevolini, Alberto, ed.   Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe . Library of the Written Word, volume 53, (Boston: Brill, 2016), 12.
43 T HE   W HO   AND   W HY   OF   THE   A NTINET     this book is the concept of an   internal ghost ,   internal monologue , and   internal  dialogue . Niklas Luhmann referenced this concept as well. The idea of the  internal ghost has been observed and studied by scholars as the interaction  between (1) external memory systems like the Antinet and (2) internal mem -  ory (which is the so-called wetware memory that resides inside your skull).  After studying John Boyle, John Locke, and Robert Hooke, one researcher  found that “annotations that are stored in the external memory can func -  tion only in tandem with internal memory, so excerpts and notes prompt  recollection of more than what they actually contain.” 14   The magic that’s  happening here is that when one interacts with notes written in one’s  own handwriting and with other external contextual details attached to it  (like the color and shape of the notecards), one’s consciousness and  memory fills in the details and other thoughts that serve as a cue for  one’s consciousness.  In other words, the notes in your Antinet set off a chain reaction—a con -  versation, internally, that becomes an internal   dialogue   (not an internal  monologue). This experience is a powerful phenomenon generated in analog  knowledge systems such as the Antinet.  Unlike digital notes, which can multiply endlessly due to virtually unlimited  storage-space limits, notes in an Antinet serve as a cue for generating the  recall   process in your mind. Digital notes take a different form; they tend to  be all-encompassing and thorough, which gets overwhelming. Your notes  should be a communication experience that takes place when you use them  to write your book, essay, blog post, or paper.  Evolution via Communication and Artificial  Consciousness  Evolution and human progress will emerge from the transition of the struc -  tural coupling of   communication and consciousness   to the structural coupling  of   communication and artificial consciousness   (by way of   externalization ).  14 Cevolini,   Forgetting Machines , 12.
44      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The best tools are the ones that lead to artificial consciousness—by  which I mean a communication partner that seems to have its own  externalized   personality . 15  Thus far, digital notetaking apps have proven useful as information storage  systems, not as artificial consciousness storage systems. The Antinet is a  better artificial consciousness storage system, and it serves as a better cue  for the internal mental dialogue when it comes time to write. Moreover,  I contend that an Antinet is, paradoxically, closer to enabling human evo -  lution than digital tools even though digital tools are perceived as being  more evolved.  WHY YOU SHOULD EVEN CARE ABOUT  LEARNING A SYSTEM THAT STRICTLY ADHERES  TO NIKLAS LUHMANN’S ZETTELKASTEN  Among scholars—and one in particular who has surveyed nearly all knowl -  edge development systems used throughout history—Niklas Luhmann’s  Zettelkasten system is decidedly one that “stands out.” Alberto Cevolini  points out that Luhmann’s paper outlining his Zettelkasten can be regarded  as modern society’s most advanced result of a long-lasting reflection per -  formed on knowledge management. 16  I contend that history’s physical analog thinking systems evolved to their  most advanced level with Luhmann’s Zettelkasten system. Instead of being  carried forth and developed from there, it has essentially been replaced  with digital notetaking tools, which I suggest are worse in many ways. The  popularity of analog thinking tools has dwindled as a consequence, and their  popularity has been supplanted with the usage of digital tools. Additionally,  the actual evolution of analog thinking systems has seemingly stopped.  I can only hope that my book will bring back some innovation in this space.  15 Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

45 T HE   W HO   AND   W HY   OF   THE   A NTINET     Each Component of Luhmann’s Principles is Unique  and They Combine to Create a Whole Greater Than  the Sum of Its Parts  In this book, I’ll detail the four principles that make Luhmann’s system  unique. The four principles combine to create the Antinet. When you  interpret Luhmann’s system loosely, it loses its luster and impact. One of  its key impacts is its proclivity to transform from a memory replacement  tool to a system that actually ends up enhancing memory—a so-called  memory aid .  The four principles of the Antinet force something called   neuro-associative  recall . Together, each aspect of the Antinet transforms it from a memo -  ry-storage system to a memory-supercharging system.  Luhmann echoes this notion. He suggests that the Antinet forces one to  file   thoughts (“placing of the notes”). While it “takes time,” according to  Luhmann, it also does two things: (1) it helps enliven the “sheer monotony  of reading,” and (2) it “incidentally trains the memory.” 17  WHY YOU SHOULD NOT BOTHER  READING THIS BOOK  Luhmann’s notebox system has become surprisingly popular recently with  the publication of several books, and it’s also become popularized through  online communities. 18   Myths about Luhmann’s system have also emerged.  One such myth is that Luhmann’s system produces prolific amounts of  writing—without the process of writing being difficult.  The author of perhaps the most popular book on Luhmann’s Zettelkasten  writes that Luhmann’s productivity is impressive, yet even more amazing  is that “[Luhmann] seemed to achieve all this with almost no real effort.” 19  17 Niklas Luhmann, Short Cuts (English Translation) (Frankfurt am Main: Zweitausendeins,  2002), 83. See the last chapter of “Short Cuts” (available in German).  18 Sönke Ahrens,   How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning  and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers .

46      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  This is a false notion that will be explored later in the book, but the result  of its proliferation is that the Zettelkasten finds itself presented as a system  that causes many people to overlook the actual realities of using it: the  truth is that Luhmann worked night and day, and his writing and theoreti -  cal work were his life. To a large degree, he produced so much because his  wife passed away, and he had a caretaker who cooked his meals and helped  him raise his children. This allowed Luhmann to focus almost exclusively  on writing. In brief, the Zettelkasten does not replace hard work; rather, it  greatly enhances the depth of thought in one’s work output; however, there’s  one caveat. Those who wish to use such a system must not shy away from  the prospect of   hard work .  Another thing that must be considered is that an Antinet is something you  should investigate if, and only if, you have adequate time. If you’re under  constant deadlines, for instance—daily deadlines, such as those experienced  by a newspaper writer—an Antinet is probably not for you. Paradoxically,  unlimited time is also not ideal either. You must have short-term projects as  milestones. Luhmann had this in the form of peer-reviewed articles. While  the number of books Luhmann published is impressive (seventy), just as  impressive is that he published 550 articles. 20   These served as short-term  projects which helped him develop his thirty-year undertaking to devise a  theory of everything   in the field of sociology.  After Luhmann passed away, two hundred more unpublished manuscripts  were found among his possessions. 21   The sheer volume of Luhmann’s output  stands as one of the main selling points for the Zettelkasten system. It’s a big  part of what has attracted many people to the concept. Further, Luhmann  continued to be productive even after he passed away with a half-dozen of  his books published posthumously. Sönke Ahrens writes that he knows  20 Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner,   Publication   Machine.”   In   Forgetting   Machines .

Luhmann’s writings are  packed with very deep ideas, yet, reading Luhmann’s work is a sleep-inducing  experience. His books are extremely and unapologetically challenging to  understand. They’re convoluted with academic jargon and unnecessarily  large words. Even Luhmann himself acknowledged the issues with his writing  style that caused him to have difficulty getting his work translated. From  observing beginners and translators who tried reading his texts, Luhmann  once remarked, “I have noticed how haphazardly I write—despite consid -  erable care in preserving and refining theoretical coherences.” 23  Hans-Georg Moeller considers Luhmann’s social theory to be the best  analysis of contemporary society presently available. Yet, he observes that  Luhmann’s work remains “far less prominent” than it ought to be. The rea -  son? Luhmann’s books were so difficult to read. 24   This same scholar wrote  an entire book dedicated to exploring Niklas Luhmann’s theoretical work.  Before even beginning the book, he allocates a section dedicated to how  and why Luhmann produced books that were so challenging. Luhmann’s  word selection, style, and tone were that of an academic who gave lectures  so dense that you left feeling like you didn’t understand a thing. This gives  you a glimpse of what reading Luhmann’s work feels like. Luhmann’s writing  style is so thickly drenched in doctrinaire academic-prose that the scholar  who wrote a book on Luhmann refers to his writing style as   soporific . 25  WHY LUHMANN’S BOOKS WERE SO BAD  The reason Niklas Luhmann’s books were so bad centers around the  following aspects:  22 Ahrens,   How to Take Smart Notes , 14.  23 Niklas Luhmann,   Short Cuts   (English), 82.  24 Hans-Georg Moeller,   The Radical Luhmann   (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 3.  25 Moeller,   The Radical Luhmann , 3.
48      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Academic Pretentiousness Described the German  Academic Climate of His Time  Luhmann’s dense academic writing style was almost a requirement in his  field if he wished to be taken seriously. It was an “environment of academi -  cally pretentious soporific authors.” 26   The greatness of one’s work correlated  directly with how inaccessible and difficult it was to penetrate. 27   In other  words, the more ridiculously challenging it was to read a person’s work, the  more respect the one who wrote it received—assuming the ideas weren’t  pure gibberish. Luhmann’s work most certainly was not gibberish; it was deep,  brilliant, unconventional, cross-disciplinary, and, astoundingly, quite valid.  Luhmann operated within the academically pretentious standard of Germa -  ny’s academic environment. As a result, his books reflect his environment.  One scholar states, “Luhmann (or rather, his writing) suffered from being  too closely associated with the German academic elite at the time.” 28  Luhmann Barely Edited His Work  “Once I’ve written [a manuscript],” Luhmann stated in an interview, “I don’t  usually revise it.” 29   In brief, he was not a perfectionist. He did not have a  writing process like F. Scott Fitzgerald, wherein he would write books in  longhand using a pencil in a notebook before typing the manuscript using  a typewriter. Luhmann wrote his texts by hand on notecards, but he put  little effort into making them cohesive and flow naturally. Luhmann was  more concerned with just getting his work shipped, as imperfect as it was.  “I don’t have any notion of perfection when it comes to books and essays,”  Luhmann said, “like some people who think they have to write a definitive  work with their first book.” 30   Luhmann considered nearly all of his roughly  seventy books, 550 articles, and two hundred unpublished manuscripts  26 Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 15.  27 Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 14.  28 Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 14.  29 Niklas Luhmann,   Short Cuts   (English), 17.  30 Niklas Luhmann,   Short Cuts   (English), 17.

In fact, he did insert new pages between existing pages of his drafts,  similar to how he made his notes branch in his Zettelkasten. For instance,  one finds manuscripts with pages   1, 2, 2 a , 2 b , 3 . The pages   2 a   and   2 b   were  inserted as an afterthought. 33   Therefore, clearly, Luhmann did some editing  after writing a manuscript.  Luhmann Desired to Be Impenetrable by the General  Public in Fear of His Career Being Threatened  There’s a dark secret in Luhmann’s life that isn’t talked about much. 34   I will  cover it later in this book; however, it provides a perfectly understandable  reason why Luhmann would want to remain impenetrable to the general  public. Because his positions in sociology are so complex, it is conceivable  that the public would have placed him in an ideologically dangerous category,  thereby threatening his career. To mitigate such a risk, one can suppose  Luhmann erred on the side of being highbrow so that only well-read intel -  lectuals could decipher what he was saying. This risked fewer opportunities  of mischaracterization from untrained readers in the social sciences.  Luhmann’s writing style helped ensure that only academics proficient and  trained in such a style would be capable of   even attempting   to understand his  work. To illustrate this point, we can refer to an interview with Luhmann from  1973. The interviewer asks Luhmann what critics he fears most, and his reply  31   Niklas Luhmann,   Short Cuts   (English), 17.  32   Undisciplined, Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt, 2021, https://www.  youtube.com/watch?v=kz2K3auPLWU, 21:40 and 28:58.  33   Undisciplined, Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt, 2021, https://www.  youtube.com/watch?v=kz2K3auPLWU, 48:30.  34   This “dark secret” of Luhmann’s life is omitted from Sönke Ahrens’ book   How  to Take Smart Notes , as well as from popular websites like zettelkasten.de
50      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  is classic: “The stupid ones.” 35   Luhmann’s writing style prevented the stupid  ones from reading his work, and it’s continued to do so long after he’s passed.  Luhmann’s Zettelkasten System Created a Deep  Spider-Like Network That Was Hard to Disentangle  Using a Typewriter  Even academics trained in reading dense prose have found themselves chal -  lenged by Luhmann’s writing style, stemming from the complex, multidisci -  plinary webs of thought Luhmann’s books dump onto the page. Luhmann  proclaimed, in a seemingly proud manner, that “there’s no linearity, but a  spider-web-like system that can be started anywhere.” 36   Such a non-linear  structure makes Luhmann’s work something that is “not reader-friendly,”  according to one scholar. 37   Luhmann asserts that the non-linear nature of  his work is a feature, not a bug. It enables one to pick up one of his books  and start reading anywhere–such as the beginning or end of the book. Yet  this assumes some familiarity with Luhmann’s work. As Moeller points out,  anyone can indeed begin reading anywhere, but they can’t start understand -  ing anywhere. 38   One can begin reading anywhere, assuming they’re already  well-versed in Luhmann’s work. Becoming well-versed in Luhmann is hard  to achieve if you start with Luhmann’s books, though it’s been said that his  lectures were easier to comprehend. 39  There’s no friendly initiation when you begin trying to read Luhmann’s work.  You’re quickly confronted with unconventional, intimidating terminology.  This terminology is packed with sudden, chaotic shifts between ideas. 40   Want  to know the best part about all this?

Let’s cover such aspects now.  Luhmann Desired to Be Impenetrable for The Sake of  Principle  Luhmann brings forth the idea that   not everything ought to be easy to under -  stand . He once posed the question: “Should everything that is said be equally  forced under the rod of comprehensibility?… Comprehensibility without  effort? Understandable without any preparation, without any time thinking  and deciphering?” 41   From this, Luhmann implied that one shouldn’t expect  all knowledge to be in a format that could be spoon-fed to those who are  not committed to the work involved in understanding advanced thought.  Advanced knowledge is something that must be earned, in other words.  It does one an injustice to make such knowledge so easily digestible; doing  such a thing waters down the impact knowledge can have on one’s mind.  Perhaps this is just a cop-out by Luhmann. After all, it’s easier to offload the  cognitive work involved in simplifying ideas. But maybe Luhmann does have  a point. It would degrade some of the world’s magic if all knowledge were  trivial to ingest. Perhaps Luhmann’s right in this respect.  Indeed, the more complex and impenetrable a subject is, the more attractive it  can become for those with a thirst for knowledge. The difficulty of deciphering  Luhmann stands as the very thing that initially attracted Johannes Schmidt  (the scholar heading up the digitization of Luhmann’s literary estate). When  Schmidt first came across Luhmann’s work, he did not understand a word of it.  41 Niklas Luhmann,   Short Cuts   (English), 6.
52      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  In making his texts challenging to decipher, Luhmann essentially filtered  out and disqualified those he could not care less about—that is, people who  weren’t serious and committed to putting in the work required to engage  with theoretical sociology.  For those serious about social theory, the complexity of Luhmann count -  er-intuitively seemed to serve as the key attraction. From there, his writing  sucked people into   The Matrix of Sociology , if you will.  In an interview with Johannes Schmidt conducted by a man who runs a  podcast covering complex philosophical and social concepts, they both  shared the same experience upon first encountering Luhmann: “When you  first read Luhmann, on the one hand, you don’t understand at all, but on  the other hand that makes you want to!” 42  We could refer to this as the phenomenon of   complexity attraction —referring  to the event wherein complexity serves as an attraction mechanism for those  passionate about a field.  Another example of   complexity attraction   is illustrated by the author of the  book,   The Radical Luhmann . He recounts a story in which an academic  friend of his missed a talk by a guest lecturer in philosophy. When the  friend asked another academic who attended the conference how it was,  the person replied in all seriousness, “It was awesome—I did not under -  stand a word!” 43  LUHMANN DESIRED TO BE IMPENETRABLE FOR  THE SAKE OF BEING AN IRREVERENT TROLL  Luhmann’s character is described as an obscure, ironic, radical thinker. 44  Perhaps today we’d consider him a bit of a troll. Luhmann has some  trollish tendencies, covered later in the book. His theories were often  quite paradoxical and, after long explanations, pointed back to them -  42   Undisciplined, “Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt,”, 6:50.  43   Moeller,   The Radical Luhmann .  44   Moeller,   The Radical Luhmann .
53 T HE   W HO   AND   W HY   OF   THE   A NTINET     selves and the beginning of where they started. He was fascinated with  self-referential systems wherein the beginning is the end, and the end  is the beginning. His Zettelkasten system reflected such ideas, which is  somewhat unsurprising.  In brief, one should not get caught up in the idea that the Zettelkasten will  magically enable you to spit out a massive number of books or papers that  are instant classics and perfect. It can undoubtedly produce excellent work;  however, the sizable amount of work Luhmann produced largely also came  from the fact that he only lightly edited his work. Furthermore, his work was  tangled in a spider-like web. Some of this is due to his Zettelkasten, which  is due to the aforementioned variables.  In my opinion, there’s a healthy balance for how to use a Zettelkasten system.  It centers around the age-old balance of   quality vs. quantity . The Antinet’s  main benefit is its ability to develop thoughts thoroughly. It truly does  help create profound ideas; however, you must also be prepared to take the  time to edit your work and make it readable for your audience—if, that is,  you wish to appeal to general readers. Instead of publishing seventy books,  if Luhmann had instead focused on making, say, ten books (and thus had  taken the additional time to make his ideas easier to digest) perhaps his  theoretical work would be much more popular than it remains today.  Using an Antinet will enable you to develop and put all the crazy, otherworldly  thoughts from your mind into a rumination system that allows it to grow.  From there, their complexity will grow. You can certainly decide to forego  simplifying your text for the general reader. Or, you can use such a system to  enable you to offload the complexity that usually lives in your mind so that  you can then create a more reader-friendly, more straightforward version  for your audience. It’s entirely up to you.  It’s essential to keep all of this in mind when deciding whether you wish to  build your own Antinet. When using an Antinet, your ideas and thoughts  will indeed be developed to a greater degree than they otherwise would. Yet,  it also means that the complexity and entanglements of your ideas will also  grow, thus requiring much editing to make your work digestible.
54      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  In brief, Luhmann’s pedantic, and overly-complex writing style can be  attributed to several things. Primarily it stems from the German academic  climate of his day. It also stems from his carnivalesque and trollish nature.  He purposely sought to be impenetrable by “stupid” critics. Yet, the Antinet  itself isn’t to blame for Luhmann’s writing voice.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, we find Umberto Eco, an Italian  scholar who used his own Antinet-like system. Eco’s notecard system, like  the Antinet, possessed web-like cross-references. However, Eco wrote in a  way that both   entertained   and   informed   his readers at the same time. 45   Just  because one uses a web-like analog system doesn’t mean their writing style  magically becomes arrogant.  Now, should you write in the trollishly pedantic academic style of Luhmann?  Or, should you opt for the   entertaining   and   informative   style of Umberto Eco?  My opinion is to follow the advice of Hemingway:   write the truth . Write the  truest sentence you can. Write with your 100% authentic voice. Your readers  can smell it on you. People are more perceptive than you think. If writing  like a trollish academic pleases you, and   if it is you , then by all means write  that way! Otherwise, err on the side of writing to   communicate , instead of  writing to confuse.  Assuming I haven’t scared you away at this point, let’s now move on to why  one would opt for an Antinet in the first place. Let’s talk about where the  Antinet shines.  WHERE THE ANTINET TRULY SHINES  The entire point of using an Antinet centers around producing unconventional,  deeply evolved thoughts. Certain aspects of an Antinet ensure unconven -  tional, deeply evolved thoughts emerge from the system, and these areas  are where it shines in comparison to other knowledge systems.  45 Umberto Eco, How to Write a Thesis, trans.

55 T HE   W HO   AND   W HY   OF   THE   A NTINET     PRODUCING GENIUS-LEVEL WORK THROUGH  CREATIVE INSIGHTS AND UNCONVENTIONAL  INTERACTIONS  Let’s start from the end result of what an Antinet aims to produce, and then  work backward from there.  An Antinet aims to produce   genius-level work . Plain and simple.  To produce genius-level work, one must unlock creative insights that  otherwise would remain disconnected in disparate fields. As a thinker,  your goal centers not on hitting targets that others find difficult to hit, but  to hit targets that others can’t even see. This comes about by unlocking  creative insights .  Nassim Nicholas Taleb observes that the primary reason for America’s  dominance in the global economy (with companies like Apple, Amazon,  Nike, Google, Facebook, etc.) all stems from one key strength:   creativity . 46  The question then becomes:   how does one unlock creative insights?  Unlocking creative insights stem from one thing:   unconventional interactions .  For something to be unconventional requires some degree of randomness  and the paradoxical quality of being true, with the insight often inspiring  a sense of awe and wonder. The requirement for interactions is   comparison .  That is, one must be able to relate and associate concepts. This primes sim -  ilar ideas to be nested and neighbored around one another so that when an  unconventional link is connected to a “neighborhood” in the Zettelkasten,  it creates unexpected ideas that emerge from viewing it in context with its  neighboring cards.  At the center of innovation rest two seemingly different concepts, from two  seemingly different contexts, that interact to create something greater than  either of those two concepts individually. This is a central idea of commu -  46   Nassim Nicholas Taleb,   The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable , 2nd ed.,  Random (New York: Random House Trade Paperbacks, 2010), 64.
56      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  nication theory—a field Luhmann’s work was deeply rooted in and that he  understood quite well. Innovation and breakthroughs in thinking happen  when two different ideas, with different goals and perspectives,   communicate  and create   new meaning . 47   This is related to the concept of   emergence   in  systems theory, in which new properties and behaviors emerge when indi -  vidual parts interact in a broader whole.  Such phenomena appear to occur more profoundly within a system such  as an Antinet. Unlike digital systems (which have the tendency of being  flooded with too much information), an analog thinking system seems  47   See Luhmann “Communicating with Slip Boxes”: “Information, accordingly, originates  only in systems which possess a comparative schema—even if this amounts only to:  “this or something else.” For communication, we do not have to presuppose that both  parties use the same comparative schema. The effect of surprise even increases when  this is not the case and when we believe that a message means something (or is useful)  against the background of other possibilities.”
57 T HE   W HO   AND   W HY   OF   THE   A NTINET     to generate fewer yet much more meaningful interactions, which, in turn,  generate creative insights that are not replicable by the system’s digital cousins.  THE ANTINET SHINES WHEN ONE DESIRES TO  DEVELOP A LONG-TERM THESIS OR SERIES OF  WORKS IN AN AREA (SUCH AS A THIRTY-YEAR  THESIS)  The reason Luhmann created his Zettelkasten in the first place is two-fold.  First, Luhmann set out to create a system for retrieving things forgotten  by memory. Yet after a certain point, as early as 1981, he discovered its true  power—his Zettelkasten became a thinking tool and communication partner  that emerged almost as if it were its own mind, a   ghost in the box . More on  this will be covered later. More pertinent right now, however, is the second  reason Luhmann started his Antinet.  The second reason relates to his main objective: to embark upon a thirty-  year-long quest to excavate a   theory of everything   as it relates to human society.  Authors like Robert Greene and Ryan Holiday have publicly shared their  notecard systems, yet their systems are quite trivial compared to an Anti -  net. They’re organized by topic or book title. They were created primarily  for writing one book, which are projects lasting one to several years. Their  notebox systems were not architected for projects with a time span of three  decades. A short-term project is more straightforward in scope than a thir -  ty-year theory of everything. This likely explains why Greene’s and Holiday’s  notebox systems don’t seem to restrict them. However, when you’re trying  to categorize and prepare for a project that will last thirty years, you must  embrace chaos. You cannot hope to have the categories you start out with be  perfectly ordered and arranged by topic forever. You can’t expect to have the  notebox adhere to the original set of organized sections over the long term.  The thoughts and ideas must emerge as your research grows. Knowledge will  emerge from the trees and branches of thought in unconventional places.  This raises some problems with category-based notebox systems, however.  Each time you finish a book, the cards live only in the silo of that project.
58      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  A great wall is seemingly hoisted around the project, preventing future work  from smoothly referencing its parts. It’s forever walled off from the other  future projects you embark upon. Its fruitful and potent ideas are blocked  off from colliding with ideas related to any future work you create. As a result,  you cannot experience the cumulative   compounding   miracle the Antinet  seems innately built for.  The   compounding   miracle cannot be unleashed if you have to start over from  scratch every time you start a new project, as evidence suggests Holiday  does each time he starts a new book. 48  Luhmann recognized this, which is one reason he architected his  Antinet in such a way. “I started the index card file,” Luhmann explained,  “because it was obvious to me I would have to plan for a lifetime not for a book.” 49  In brief, the Antinet is best for long-term projects and also if you intend  to leverage the miracle of compounding your ideas over a thirty-year-plus  timeframe. That doesn’t mean you must commit to working on one project  for thirty years; instead, it means you must commit to having your work  compound and interact with itself over thirty years (this is made possible  by way of the Antinet’s structure).  Other problems with categorical-based notebox systems will be outlined  later on in the book.  THE ANTINET SHINES IN REVEALING  STRUCTURED ACCIDENTS  The Antinet enables users to slow down their minds and develop their  thoughts. It also excels in stimulating one to think of associated ideas and then  48   Ryan Holiday, “The Notecard System: The Key For Remembering, Organizing And  Using Everything You Read,” RyanHoliday.Net (blog), April 1, 2014, https://ryanhol -  iday.net/the-notecard-system-the-key-for-remembering-organizing-and-using-every -  thing-you-read/.

59 T HE   W HO   AND   W HY   OF   THE   A NTINET     link to those ideas in the note. Some confuse this (the concept of linking)  as the unique benefit of Luhmann’s system; however, this is not the case.  The practice of reading something and writing the idea immediately into a  digital markdown file, and then linking that file to some other idea is not  what is meant by   unconventional interactions . For something to be an   uncon -  ventional interaction , it must genuinely be unconventional. Nearly anyone can  search their digital notes to find keywords related to the current idea they  just wrote down and link that idea. The idea of simply linking your notes in  this way is a misinterpretation that plagues countless numbers of people in  the digital Zettelkasten world.  For instance, David Kadavy’s book about digital Zettelkästen outlines the  advantage of the system, stating that you activate your mind’s “associative”  machine when you think of a related concept in your mind, which “collides”  with another related idea. 50   While this is true to a degree, it largely misses  the mark. Here’s why:  The point of the Antinet is its ability to serve as a thinking machine, as a  knowledge development system, and as an   extended memory . The system  forces the user to think of the keyterm they would use to describe a concept.  Only after this critical step do you look up the concept and go through your  notes and compare and remind yourself of the things you’ve forgotten in the  process. The magic of an Antinet does not center on one’s ability to think  about what a new concept you’ve read relates to (as that’s a conventional  interaction, not an unconventional interaction). Rather, as Luhmann puts  it, its magic stems from “interactions that were never planned, never pre -  conceived, or conceived” by your   current   way of thinking. 51  50   David Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten: Principles, Methods,   &   Examples , Kindle Edition  (Kadavy, Inc.), 35. “By trying to think of how to describe the passage in my own words,  I activate the associative machine, which often causes the current idea to collide with  some other idea in my mind. Associative thinking promotes a positive mood, so it  shouldn’t be a surprise how fun this task is. If writing a passage makes me think of some -  thing related, I write it in parentheses.”  51   Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes”: “The slip box provides combinatorial pos -  sibilities which were never planned, never preconceived, or conceived in this way.”
60      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The magic of innovation and of unlocking creativity stems from the possi -  bility of (1) making relations using the term you’re currently thinking of, but  more importantly (2) the analog nature of the system with its tree-structure  (which you’ll learn about later in the book), ends up inducing   structured  accidents   that are otherwise impossible to replicate. 52  This is why it’s critical, in Luhmann’s words, that your “selection and com -  parisons are not identical with the schema of searching for them.” 53   Why is  this the case? Because simply searching for a keyword, digitally, robs the  potential for innovation to occur   not   through seeing what you felt was   related  in that moment, but through the ingenious, unconventional discoveries you  make along the way navigating to the nearby cards, and nearby branches  of thought that have emerged and evolved around the cards you’re looking  for. This tree-like structure, of which the Antinet is comprised, is what helps  unlock truly   unconventional interactions . The concept of the tree-like structure  is something to be covered in detail later in this book.  52   Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes”: “The communication with the slip box  becomes fruitful only at a high level of generalization, namely that of establishing com -  municative relations of relations. And it becomes productive only at the moment of eval -  uation, and is thus bound to a certain time and is to a high degree accidental.”  53   Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes”: “This effect of innovation is based on the  one hand on the circumstance that the query provokes possibilities of making relations  which could not be traced prior to it. On the other hand, it is based also on the fact that  the internal horizons of selection and comparisons are not identical with schema of  searching for them.”
61  C H A PT E R T H R E E  �  THE CURRENT ZETTELKASTEN  LANDSCAPE  WHY I DECIDED TO WRITE THIS BOOK  L et’s first start with why   i   am   not   writing a book about the Antinet  (i.e., an analog Zettelkasten).  I am not writing a book on the Antinet to sell a massive number of books.  As mentioned, I started out working with an Antinet because I desired to  write about my interests in other fields (specifically: marketing, copywrit -  ing, philosophy, and psychology). While working on a book in these fields,  I decided to use an analog Zettelkasten to help me. In doing this, I discovered  how wrong the conventional wisdom is about Zettelkasten. I had to learn this  the hard way. In order to figure out the truth, I went straight to the original  source: Luhmann’s online archive. I spent many months reverse-engineer -  ing Luhmann’s Zettelkasten. I wrote out many of his notecards by hand to  understand how it truly works. I discovered that the Zettelkasten is much  different than how it’s described everywhere else.  I think it’s important to publish this book on the Antinet because there’s  already a wealth of wonderful books in the field of marketing, copywrit -  ing, and psychology. Within the realm of Zettelkasten, there’s really only  one dominant book out there right now:   How to Take Smart Notes   by  Sönke Ahrens.  This would be fine if the book was excellent; however, there are two issues  with the book. First, it contains information that gets the most critical
62      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  pieces of the Zettelkasten wrong. And second, many people don’t even  realize Ahrens’s book exists. This becomes problematic because the online  environment for gaining an accurate understanding of a Zettelkasten is  even worse. I surveyed the top nine search engine results for the term  “Zettelkasten.” In brief, every one of them contains flaws in their description  of what a Zettelkasten is.  When searching for the term “Zettelkasten” on Google, the first result is  Wikipedia’s entry for Zettelkasten. This entry gets it wrong in several ways.  First, it describes the Zettelkasten as a hierarchical structure. 1   This is wrong.  A Zettelkasten is a tree-like structure wherein each leaf is of the same impor -  tance as any other. Each leaf, like each note, just lives in a different location  on a tree. Second, Wikipedia posits a Zettelkasten as something built in  digital format using “specialist knowledge management software.” The entry  then reluctantly admits that it “can be done on paper using index cards.” 2  In reality, the true power of Zettelkasten revolves around the fact that it  is—in its very essence—an actual notebox!  The second result I was given was the website zettelkasten.de. 3   When I  first began surveying the top search results for Zettelkasten, I landed on a  “Lessons Learned” post on the home page of zettelkasten.de. The post was  written by a machine-learning researcher who shared his journey using  a Zettelkasten. This researcher mentioned the frustration using   tags . The  site owners responded, sharing their frustrations with tags, saying that the  “mess” it creates resonated with them. Yet as a solution, they referenced a  1   “Zettelkasten,” in Wikipedia, June 8, 2021, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?ti -  tle=Zettelkasten&oldid=1027589556. “The notes are numbered hierarchically, so that  new notes may be inserted at the appropriate place, and contain metadata to allow the  note-taker to associate notes with each other.”  2   “Zettelkasten,” in Wikipedia.  3   I am grateful for this website and its owners and operators. They have done much to  proselytize the idea of Zettelkasten. I have since become friends with the two individ -  uals who operate the website. I find them very open-minded and receptive to my views.  Still, I possess different philosophical views, and I disagree with them on several fronts  (when it comes to Zettelkasten). Naturally, this is the case as I’m a fervent adopter of the  analog Zettelkasten in its purest form.
63 T HE   C URRENT   Z ETTELKASTEN   L ANDSCAPE     post that discusses a distinction between   good and bad tags . 4   To me, this just  seems like complexity built on unnecessary complexity. Remember, I was  very new to the field of Zettelkasten at the time. I soon discovered that the  creator of Zettelkasten, Niklas Luhmann, never used   tags . This illustrates  what I believe happens to many people who are new to Zettelkasten. They  end up stumbling across these types of online posts and find themselves  unnecessarily confused.  The search engine’s third result on the term “Zettelkasten” also came from  zettelkasten.de. It was the   Getting Started Overview   page where one finds  advice such as “Don’t use categories. Use tags instead.” 5   The problem here is  twofold. First, as stated previously, Luhmann never used   tags   (as the concept  was not yet invented). And second, Luhmann didn’t even subscribe to this  notion in spirit. Luhmann used categories and top-level sections for his  Zettelkasten. They weren’t strict categories like the Dewey Decimal system.  They were more like   rough   starting points. Nonetheless, they were indeed  categories. In Luhmann’s first Zettelkasten, he had 108 categories. His second  Zettelkasten was more narrowly focused on his sociological work, yet it still  contained 11 top-level categories. 6  The next handful of search engine results suffers similar inaccuracies. They  contain material overly focused on the digitized—and in my opinion,  compromised—version of the Zettelkasten. They also include complete  inventions first devised by Sönke Ahrens. They also confuse Luhmann’s  numeric-alpha notecard address system by telling readers to use dates for  4   @boxcariii, “Field Report #2: Lessons Learned From Processing,” Zettelkasten Method,  57:36 100AD, https://zettelkasten.de/posts/field-report-2-lessons-learned/. “…Oh man,  the “my tags are a mess” part resonated with me.

I believe there are only a handful of sources the inquisitive are left with if  they wish to gain an accurate understanding of Zettelkasten in its purest  form (the analog form). Those sources are (1) the online archive of Niklas  Luhmann’s actual Zettelkasten, (2) the paper outlining Zettelkasten written  by Niklas Luhmann himself, titled,   Communication with Noteboxes , (3) the  works of Johannes Schmidt, a scholar at Bielefeld University who heads up  Luhmann’s archive project, and who has studied Luhmann’s materials closest. 9  These three sources are difficult to penetrate and understand. With pen and  notecards in hand, I spent one month reading Luhmann’s paper,   Communi -  cation with Noteboxes . When printed out, this paper totals a mere four pages.  It’s so densely written it requires very careful reading in order to grasp what  is being said. I spent over a month reading this paper! Yet, my careful review  was worth it; there is so much to learn by reading the paper. I spent about  six weeks doing the same thing with Johannes Schmidt’s in-depth article  on Luhmann’s Zettelkasten. 10   This, too, was a very dense read.  7   “A Beginner’s Guide to the Zettelkasten Method,”   Zenkit   (blog), April 29, 2021, https://  zenkit.com/en/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-zettelkasten-method/; Rebecca Williams,  “The Zettelkasten Method: Examples to Help You Get Started.,” Medium, October 5, 2020,  https://medium.com/@rebeccawilliams   9941/the-zettelkasten-method-examples-to-  help-you-get-started-8f844fa9ae6; David B.

Instead,  I tell you this in case you’re curious and want to venture down the rabbit-hole  of Zettelkasten knowledge yourself. These are the primary sources. They’re  difficult. Thankfully, however, you don’t have to spend weeks trying to  piece together a Zettelkasten from those few articles. That’s why I’m here—  to introduce to you the world of the   real   Zettelkasten (without boring the  heck out of you with dense academic prose). Even if I do bore the heck out  of you in some parts, just know that it could be worse, much worse. If you  doubt that, just try reading Luhmann’s paper!  Before moving on, let me first outline my intent in describing the misin -  terpretations others hold in regards to Zettelkasten. I am not doing this  because I’m motivated by some sadistic pleasure gained from criticizing the  well-intentioned work of others. 11   In fact, I feel bad about calling to light what  I see as the errors and misinterpretations of such people. Every individual  I’ve come across in the personal knowledge management and Zettelkasten  fields are well-intentioned. Granted these people often sell online courses,  or online consulting, and have agendas related to those sales; yet it’s not  disguised. It’s quite apparent what the catch is. Every one of them believes  he or she is teaching material that will help people produce better knowledge.  Moreover, much of the proselytizers of Zettelkasten knowledge come close  to getting things right. Indeed, some authors share useful principles that  even Luhmann himself did not bother mentioning. 12  As I was learning Luhmann’s Zettelkasten myself, I observed something  that reminded me of a cognitive error called the   availability cascade . Even if  you’re unfamiliar with the term, you’re undoubtedly familiar with its con -  cept.

It occurs as  the result of encapsulating a novel and complex concept into a simplified  version—and here’s the key part—the simplified version is slightly less  accurate. This creates a waterfall of incorrect information that re-circulates  itself and spreads rapidly. Why? Because simpler ideas spread more easily.  Recently, a study at UC San Diego was published showcasing the   availability  cascade . The study found that research that is less likely to be true is cited  153 times more if the material is interesting. Implicit in this is the following  idea: research spreads more if it’s   simplified   enough to be   interesting   in the  first place (regardless of its accuracy).  The phenomenon of the   availability cascade   finds itself ever-so-present within  the land of Zettelkasten. It’s negatively affecting every well-intentioned  knowledge worker who becomes hopeful and excited about Zettelkasten.  Here’s why: a second wave of teachers of the Zettelkasten finds itself emerging  right now. Most of them do not use the primary sources as their material  for teaching others about what a Zettelkasten is. Instead, this new wave of  Zettelkasten evangelists use Sönke Ahrens’s work, namely his book   How to  Take Smart Notes , as the primary material on which they rely. 13   The problem  with these new Zettelkasten evangelists is not just their misunderstanding of  how the Zettelkasten truly works, but also the contradictions they introduce. 14  For instance, one self-declared bestselling author published a book recently  on how the Zettelkasten works. 15   His book not only preaches Ahrens’s work,  it appends new inventions onto it. As a result, one is left with inventions  13 “10 Principles to Revolutionize Your Note-Taking and Writing” ; David Kadavy,   Digital  Zettelkasten: Principles, Methods, & Examples   (Kadavy, Inc., 2022), 7; “A Beginner’s  Guide to the Zettelkasten Method,”   Zenkit   (blog); Williams, “The Zettelkasten Method.  14   For instance, you find authors asserting things like the analog Zettelkasten has a “slow rate”  of exposing users to information, and thus “reduces your focus.” Whereas, in reality the  exact opposite is found to be as true. For the source of such contradictions, see: Kadavy,  Digital Zettelkasten : “You may find it easier to sort through digital notes than paper, or you  may find the slow rate with which you’re exposed to new information with paper notes  reduces your focus.”  15   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 64.

They derive from a new quasi-religion that has  developed a rather malignant growth inside the world of Zettelkasten. I call  this quasi-religion,   Ahrensianity .  AHRENSIANITY  Mark Twain once wrote to himself privately in his notebook, “If Christ were  here there is one thing he would not be—a Christian.” 16   This indeed may be  true. After all, Jesus referred to himself as Jewish and never called himself  a “Christian,” for one. Second, he was a poor Galilean who was illiterate  and didn’t speak Greek (the language the New Testament was written in).  Where did “Christian” come from then? From the early Hellenic-Jewish  Apostle named Paul—a man who never met nor knew Jesus, yet who served  as a forceful voice in the formative decades after the death of Jesus. Paul’s  teachings and writings formed the core beliefs and doctrines of Christianity.  In brief, his interpretations of a remote Jew he didn’t even know are what  ended up giving birth to Christianity as we know it. 17  Since the 1700s, scholars have been publishing arguments that show how  Paul’s teachings differ from and contradict Jesus’s teachings. Furthermore,  Paul’s teachings add inventions to Jesus’s preachings that were never held  by Jesus. This has given rise to the term “Pauline Christianity,” or “Paulism,”  which the world today knows as Christianity. Yet, again, this body of teach -  ings finds itself profoundly different from that of the founder—Jesus of  Nazareth. 18   I don’t know about you, but I’m a much bigger fan of Jesus of  Nazareth and his teachings, than I am of religious dogma.  It may seem absurd, but the phenomenon of Paul learning of Jesus and  then inventing the notion of Christianity is similar to that of Sönke Ahrens  learning of Niklas Luhmann and inventing the notion of Zettelkasten. Yet  16   “Mark Twain Quotations—Christianity,” accessed July 1, 2021, http://www.twain  quotes.com/Christianity.html.  17   Reza Aslan,   Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth , Reprint edition (New  York: Random House Trade Paperbacks, 2014), 171, 186–7.  18   Aslan,   Zealot , 190.
68      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  what Ahrens teaches is not the Zettelkasten system as Luhmann conceived  of it; rather it contains its own flavor and spin. Yet, with Ahrens’s insistence  on the idea that the power of the Zettelkasten revolves around the mere  linking of notes (in digital form), it’s perhaps been taken even further away  from the original form than what Paul did to Jesus’s teachings.  In brief, Ahrens’s   interpretations of Zettelkasten   should not be called   Zettelkas -  ten . It should be called   Ahrenskasten , or perhaps…Ahrensianity!  The doctrine of Ahrensianity is composed, primarily, of three types of notes:  (1) fleeting notes, (2) literature notes, and (3) permanent notes. All three  of these notes stand as an invention and were never terms Niklas Luhmann  used. Of the three, perhaps literature notes are closest to what Luhmann  actually did; however, there are even issues with the description of such  notes in Ahrens’s book.  THE LATTER-DAY AHRENSIANS  In a newly released book with Zettelkasten in its title, David Kadavy pro -  ceeds to illustrate the doctrine of Ahrensianity in his chapter, “Anatomy of  a Zettelkasten.” 19   He then adds his own inventions by adding three more  components to the mix: “inbox,” “someday/maybe,” and “raw.” This leaves  us with even more complexity built on top of something not even based  entirely on Zettelkasten in the first place (but rather based on the interpre -  tations of Sönke Ahrens). 20   This is an example of   interpretations piling on top  of interpretations . Meet the latter-day Ahrensians.  As mentioned briefly, there exist confusion and contradictions within this  new wave of Zettelkasten interpretation. After exposure to the lessons of  Sönke Ahrens and observing confusing and contradictory reasoning brought  19   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 25.  20   Perhaps this is why the Bible’s Book of Revelations began implementing the first crude  form of copyright law in warning copyists and scribes who were liberal with their in -  terpretations of their texts!

69 T HE   C URRENT   Z ETTELKASTEN   L ANDSCAPE     forth by the new wave of Ahrensian devotees, it becomes clear why it’s so  crucial to properly understand Zettelkasten.  For instance, one finds authors both touting the benefits of digital notes for  enabling search functionality, and devaluing the analog method. Kadavy does  this by stating that because an analog Zettelkasten possesses a “slow rate” of  exposing users to information while using it, it consequently “reduces your  focus.” 21   In brief, this notion is absurd. It even conflicts with what Ahrens  would admit as a primary benefit of analog.  This demonstrates something that is happening at a more rapid pace within  the field of Zettelkasten. We have Kadavy, an Ahrensian follower, providing  an example of why digital-based thinking and notetaking may be better  because of   search   functionality. We also have him adding his own spin on  top of the Ahrensian spin and advocating for digital search functionality  of a notetaking system because, he asserts, more exposure to information  will increase one’s focus. 22   Again, this is absurd. But the contradictions get  worse: ten pages after asserting this, Kadavy advises readers to   not worry  about being “efficient.” 23   He goes on to declare that the “bottleneck” of great  ideas does not stem from the speed and quantity of writing and thinking,  but from slow, consistent, hard, and deliberate thought. 24  In essence, an author who wrote a book on digital Zettelkasten finds himself  really an advocate of the analog Zettelkasten—yet perhaps he’s too blind to  see its power. He’s blinded by the digital age we live in, and seems so con -  vinced of the technologies it’s yielded. Yet he discounts the technology of  the organ that resides inside one’s skull. This technology, the human brain,  21   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 19.  22   There are several reasons the notion that   being exposed to more information causes one’s  focus to increase is absurd . One reason comes from the findings of Nobel Prize winner,  Herbert Simon, who observed that more information exposure is directly and negatively  correlated with one thing—you guessed it!—focus. In brief, information exposure kills  attention.  23   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 29.  24   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 29.
70      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  seems to do better in environments where its allowed to slow down and  think on paper (when it comes to writing, at least).  A Lesson from Robert Caro  Where does slow, consistent, hard, and deliberate thought come from? Let’s  ask two-time Pulitzer Prize winning author, Robert Caro. In an interview,  Caro was asked why he wrote out all of his books long-hand first, and then  by typewriter. Caro responded, “It’s to slow myself down.” He concludes,  “If I write by hand it’s a little bit slower and I think things through.” 25  How did Caro learn the power of such a method? He learned it early in  his writing career. One of Caro’s writing professors once imparted advice  to him. The advice ended up exposing Caro’s writing methods at the time.  As Caro recounts of the experience: “You know, sometimes you know when  someone has seen right through you.” Right then and there Caro knew his  professor had seen through him. What Caro was referring to was the advice  he received from his professor: “Mr. Caro, you’re never going to achieve  what you want to achieve unless you learn to stop thinking with your fingers.”  By this, Caro’s professor meant that Caro must stop just writing papers  directly using his typewriter. Instead Caro ought to slow down and think  on paper, with a pen. When Caro wrote his first book, he changed up  his process. At the time he was still not heeding his professor’s advice.  Why? Because he was “a newspaper man” and time was of the essence.  Yet, when he set out to write his book, he switched. When he set out to  write his book, he first wrote the draft in longhand, and then he wrote it  out via typewriter. 26  In summary, slow, consistent, deliberate thought comes from the world of  analog. Specifically, it comes from writing by hand.

Those Who Teach Zettelkasten Don’t Even Know  What a Zettelkasten Truly Is  Unless you’re a careful and scrutinizing reader, these seemingly contradictory  positions may go unnoticed. However, since you’re now privy to Ahrensianity,  you are better equipped for two things. First, you’ll find it easier to spot such  contradictions when you read an article about Zettelkasten that, in reality,  is teaching the Ahrensian interpretation of Luhmann’s Zettelkasten (and  not the real authentic Zettelkasten); and second, you will understand   why  the author is confused in the first place. The reason the author is confused  about what a Zettelkasten is, is simply this: a Zettelkasten isn’t merely a  notetaking methodology. A Zettelkasten is a method to build your own  person—a second version of yourself with whom you can communicate—  a   second mind . More on this will be explored in detail later in the book.  An Example Contradiction: Dynamically Updating Links  A key feature of digital Zettelkasten apps is the dynamic updating of links  across all files when you update the filename. In other words, when you  edit a note’s filename, all other notes that link to that filename dynamically  update as well (so that the links don’t break). This is an important feature  because the majority of digital “Zettelkasten” are not truly Zettelkasten.  A true Zettelkasten system has numeric-alpha filenames ( e.g. 2701/1A ).  Apps without the dynamic-updating function instead utilize filenames that  are typically a human-readable concept name. For instance, a note that out -  lines   confirmation bias   would typically be named   confirmation bias.md . If  one were to, for instance, change the filename from   confirmation bias.md  to   confirmation fallacy.md , then all of the links pointing to the original  would break. One would have to use the   find-and-replace-all   text feature to  fix the broken links. This is not the case with the dynamic updating feature  in certain notetaking apps. As a result, much time is saved with the valuable  dynamic updating feature.  In essence, the ability to dynamically update links is quite useful for those  who use digital Zettelkasten. Yet, one finds authors writing about these
72      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  apps contradicting the value of such a feature. Kadavy flat out states that it  is an “overrated feature” for digital Zettelkasten. 27   I don’t even use a digital  Zettelkasten, nor do I wish to, yet even I can see how poorly informed this  opinion is! Such an assertion could be understandable if one were using  numeric-alpha addresses (that is, is using Zettelkasten in its truer form), as  there would be no reason for the filenames to ever change in the first place.  The numeric-alpha naming convention Luhmann devised enables one to  infinitely internally branch thoughts and link all entries anywhere. In fact,  the reason one ought   never   to update filenames is that mistakes or odd  conventions (and old naming of concepts) prove quite valuable. Moreover,  they form odd clusters that order themselves in unique ways allowing one to  observe the evolution of one’s thinking. This is invaluable for the   knowledge  development system   that a Zettelkasten is.  Another Contradiction:  Linking Notes vs. Rewriting Ideas  The very same author who undermines the value of dynamic links in a  digital Zettelkasten makes an even more absurd statement that introduces  confusion for those wishing to become more effective knowledge creators.  Kadavy states that   linking   is overrated and he supports rewriting instead of  linking. Why? He reasons that it’s easier to just rewrite things by typing. 28  I find this rather absurd because it diminishes the major premise of a digital  Zettelkasten: the attractiveness of a digital Zettelkasten, in comparison with  a digital note database, centers on the benefit of linking thoughts. One ratio -  nale for this is that by linking, users need not constantly rewrite everything.  Instead, they can revise and develop the thought that they link to. Many  first-generation Ahrensian followers base their biggest idea around that of  linking thoughts. 29   For this reason, it becomes a bit of a mess when one digital  Zettelkasten follower promotes one idea and the other promotes the exact  opposite notion. At the center of this mess rests the core of it all: basing one’s  teachings on someone other than the system’s creator (Niklas Luhmann).  27   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 30.  28   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 31.  29 “Linking Your Thinking,” accessed July 7, 2021, https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/.
73 T HE   C URRENT   Z ETTELKASTEN   L ANDSCAPE     Instead, when you base your opinion on an early Zettelkasten apostle (Sönke  Ahrens), you’re left with contradictions. You’ll find one digital Zettelkasten  teacher advocating for one thing, and a different digital Zettelkasten teacher  advocating for the exact opposite. The key lesson here? Start with Luhmann,  start with the original source, and then work backwards from there.  Another Contradiction: Highlighting Books  Advising readers to highlight books while reading is something Luhmann  never did. Yet we find such advice from Kadavy, the teacher of digital  Zettelkasten methods. This author advises readers to highlight text in their  e-readers. 30   This goes against even Sönke Ahrens’s advice. Further, Kadavy  then advises readers to “highlight the highlights.” 31  On the matter of highlighting texts, I will say this: highlighting is not advis -  able. It is not a good method for focused reading of challenging and complex  information. For challenging material, it’s best to invest the time required to  reformulate it, and reflect on it in the form of notes. There are no shortcuts.  While highlighting does not possess the cognitive-development power of  reformulating and reflecting on information, it is not “completely pointless,”  as one cognitive scientist, Fiona McPherson, points out. The reason it’s not  completely pointless   is that highlighting books can have the helpful effect of  forcing one to actually read the words. 32  But look at what the cognitive scientist is really admitting here. Her main  point is that highlighting is not   completely pointless ; it’s just barely above  completely pointless . In other words, it’s   mostly pointless .  I’d advise you to stay away from the practice of highlighting. If the material  is familiar to you, and especially if it’s complicated, highlighting won’t help  30   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 31.  31   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 33.  32   Fiona McPherson,   Effective Note-taking , revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 17.
74      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  much. Furthermore, research shows that highlighting may even “harm” your  ability to recall information in certain scenarios. 33  As McPherson observes, the main value of highlighting does not intrinsically  add much value to your understanding of the material. Its main benefit centers  on its ability to motivate one to spend   more time   with the material. 34   This  effect caused by spending   more time   with material will resurface throughout  this book. Perhaps not so ironically, the reason the analog Zettelkasten out -  weighs the effectiveness of digital Zettelkasten is because the analog form  forces users to spend   more time   developing thoughts.  Direct Contradictions of Luhmann’s Teachings  I’ve laid out several contradictions that have emerged within recent digital  Zettelkasten teachings. Unfortunately, many more continue to rise to the  surface. Some contradictions are even more severe than others.  There are also direct contradictions of Luhmann’s teachings. For instance,  Luhmann calls the Zettelkasten a “universal instrument” which accepts  any keyterm one wishes to create in the index. 35   Even the simple, isolated  basic keyterm of “ Picasso”   is fine, as Luhmann says, because it may unlock  accidental insights. 36   According to Luhmann, it’s more fruitful to create  keyterms that generalize different things, and relate heterogeneous things  to a larger theme or observation. More on this will be explained later in this  book. However, we find Kadavy citing Ahrens on how one ought to select  keyterms for tagging. 37   Note that he cites Ahrens instead of the creator of  the Zettelkasten, Niklas Luhmann. He then prescribes to the reader the  33   McPherson,   Effective Note-taking , 23; James H.

75 T HE   C URRENT   Z ETTELKASTEN   L ANDSCAPE     following directive: “avoid generic keywords, such as ‘psychology’.”   38   This  directly conflicts with Luhmann describing the Zettelkasten as a “universal  instrument” into which one can place almost any keyterm and get back  unconventional insights .  Unfortunately, those who accept such advice may never experience the  magic and accidental insights generated by working with an analog thinking  system. While the analog route may seem difficult at first, the alternative isn’t  that nice and pretty. Furthermore, it’s rather vague. For instance, toward the  end of Kadavy’s book on digital Zettelkasten, there’s a section that debates  “linking vs. tagging vs. both.” 39   Luhmann never found himself bothered with  such drivel because, as I’ve already stated, the concept of tagging notes didn’t  exist. Kadavy’s solution to this topic remains to be decided by the reader as  he concludes, “there’s no right answer.”   40   Actually, there is a right answer.  Do what Luhmann did, and use an analog thinking system and stop worrying  about such irrelevant things!  Stripping Away The Importance of The Numeric-  Alpha Card Addresses  Within the Latter-day Ahrensian Zettelkasten school, there exists a more  pernicious contradiction of the original form that promotes downplaying  the importance of numeric-alpha card addresses.  If you wish to take Luhmann seriously, then you must accept his notion that  an alter ego arises out of an analog Zettelkasten. A   ghost in the box   arises in  the form of a   second mind   (if you structure your analog Zettelkasten properly).  This creates an entity that allows you to   communicate   with it in the first place.  As Luhmann makes clear, the numeric-alpha card addresses are a key com -  ponent that “makes possible its ability to communicate in the first place.” 41  38   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 48.  39   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 50.  40   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 50.  41   Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes.”
76      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  It becomes, therefore, quite confusing when digital Zettelkasten proponents  take a nonchalant approach to this concept—if they even decide to mention  it at all, that is! 42  For instance, Kadavy’s book that supposedly teaches digital Zettelkasten starts  off the chapter on file identification with, “A big debate among Zettelkasten  practitioners is file-naming convention.” 43   In reality, there is no debate if one  is to subscribe to the Zettelkasten in its truest form. Yet the author of this  book carries on and lists out four options to choose from.  Here are the recommendations described by the author:  The first option this author lists is to use “phrases” in the filename. This  practice is precisely what Luhmann says one   should not   do! Luhmann  explicitly advises that the Zettelkasten must not   rely on a structure that uses  content-based order. 44  The second option Kadavy lays out for IDs is that of an ugly date-timestamp  number. 45   This makes very little sense, as the magic of Zettelkasten revolves  around the idea that you branch internally, in an infinite manner based on  the idea—not the time and date in which that idea formed. Date-time IDs  destroy the beauty of the numeric-alpha convention Luhmann used. It adds  complicated bloat to something that is otherwise so simple.  The third option for IDs Kadavy mentions is, in his words, “the most com -  plicated naming convention.” 46   He references the naming convention called  42   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten ; “Building a Second Brain: An Overview,”   Forte Labs ,  February 20, 2019, https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/.  43   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 38. Mind you, the author’s discussion of what Luhmann  deemed a “most important [decision]” in constructing a Zettelkasten, doesn’t arrive un -  til chapter eleven of this author’s book on digital Zettelkasten .  44   Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes.” “Fixed numbers, abstracted from any  content-based order relying on the entire structure has a number of advantages which,  taken together, enable us to reach a higher type of order.”  45   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 39.  46   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 40.

This is a term that has, for some odd reason, gained popularity  amongst the new digital Zettelkasten school (note: Luhmann actually never  used the term). What this term means is essentially an address affixed to each  card that is numeric-alpha and that can be branched, and internally evolved  (e.g.   2412/1A/1 ). I will not go into detail on this now, as it’s a core component  of the Antinet and will be discussed in great length later on. The author  goes on to declare it as “unnecessary” for building a digital Zettelkasten.  But something that is even more unnecessary in a digital Zettelkasten is…  the digital part!  Where Kadavy goes from bad to worse, however, is in his misunderstanding  of what numeric-alpha card addresses actually are. He states that it forces  a “hierarchical arrangement of notes in a system supposed to be non-hier -  archical.” 47   This notion is absurd. Each note in the Antinet is like a leaf on a  tree. Every leaf on a tree is of the same class as other leaves; they just live in a  different location on the tree. As Johannes Schmidt points out “the position  of a special subject or card says nothing of the theoretical importance of the  card.” As far as hierarchy, “there’s no bottom and there’s no top.” 48   Secondly,  who stated that the Zettelkasten is “supposed to be non-hierarchical?” Even  though an analog Zettelkasten (and its numeric-alpha card addresses) is not  hierarchical (which the author gets wrong), the notion that a Zettelkasten  is “supposed to be non-hierarchical” stands as a myth.  Kadavy outlines the final option for how to identify one’s notes:   use a com -  bination of mixing up all three of these options . 49   This is fine advice if you wish  to spend your days reading and spinning your wheels in the mud trying to  make use of what you’ve just read.  From this one starts to get a glimpse of how much of a mess the current  landscape is for English-speaking people who dare do an internet search  for the term “Zettelkasten.” Just as an illustration, if you end up searching  47   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 43.  48   Undisciplined, “Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt,” 2021, https://www.you  tube.com/watch?v=kz2K3auPLWU, 37:20.  49   Kadavy,   Digital Zettelkasten , 46.

This misinformation continues to spread at a rapid pace. The   availability  cascade   of inaccurate but simplistic Zettelkasten information exacerbates the  issue, and it’s getting harder for potential users to grasp what the Zettelkasten  system actually was, and is.  The Problem with Latter-Day Ahrensian Teachings  The problem with the teachings of those basing their source material off of  Sönke Ahrens’s publications is the fact that all of the subtleties and magic of  the Zettelkasten are discarded. There exists a magic in building a pen-and-  paper-based system, a communication partner, an alter-ego, a   second mind .  This type of system creates accidents and randomness that are invaluable. Its  essence is watered down, if not altogether nuked by its digital, inbred, cousins.  It’s unfortunate that those who teach the Zettelkasten system have missed out  on the true underlying magic of Luhmann’s system in its purest form. Going  in search of the magic requires a person to be rather crazy (like yours truly).  You must take a risk and purchase the materials required and go through  the long slog of creating your own analog Zettelkasten (using only pen and  notecards). Furthermore, it’s a lonely journey as there’s not much information  out there about how to build an analog Zettelkasten (though hopefully I’ll  help make the road less lonely). It’s also one that may be filled with missteps  that are hard to correct given the fact that there’s no   find-and-replace-all   func -  tionality. Yet it’s worth the investment. Sure, it’s unfortunate that these digital  Zettelkasten teachers never discovered the true magic of Zettelkasten. But it’s  more unfortunate that they end up unintentionally misleading others who  may have otherwise put in the work to build a true Zettelkasten (if they had  only known how it really works and what is to be gained by it).  WHY I DECIDED TO WRITE A BOOK  ABOUT THE ZETTELKASTEN  Even though the information landscape pertaining to Zettelkasten is riddled  with inaccurate information, it’s not the reason I decided to publish a book

Second, if I don’t write about what I’ve learned about Zettelkasten now  (while my passion for it is still fresh), then I probably never will.  Third, and most importantly, I actually care about sharing this information  because I care about the people who would potentially waste their lives  learning the wrong methods and techniques to build a Zettelkasten. I believe  that many people have, are, and will waste their precious life energy learning  the ins-and-outs of digital apps instead of creating the genius-level work  they’re capable of.  Why do I care to publish my findings on the Zettelkasten? I’d like to think  it’s because I’m a saint, and that it’s simply just   the right thing to do . But  seriously, I think the reason why I care about such people like yourself is  because I was once in your shoes.  I very clearly recall the confusion I experienced and even the suffering I  experienced from not knowing   how   to organize all the thoughts floating  around in my head.  I care to share with you what I’ve learned because I’ve seen the faces of  those in the community of people who are eager to learn. When I took an  online course on personal knowledge management, I interacted with people  like you—people who are committed to growth and learning. That course

Now, before we get into the core of the Antinet, let’s first dive into the  mind of its creator: Niklas Luhmann.

81  C H A PT E R FO U R  �  NIKLAS LUHMANN,  THE MAN  B efore we begin diving   into Niklas Luhmann’s notebox system, there’s  one area worth first exploring: Niklas Luhmann, the man. That is,  Luhmann’s background, his theories, his beliefs, and his attitudes.  WHY IT’S IMPORTANT TO GAIN  FAMILIARITY WITH NIKLAS LUHMANN  The structure, spirit and personality of the Antinet carries imprints of its  biggest contributor, Niklas Luhmann.  The Antinet enables one to be “light of mind” amidst the complexity of  knowledge. This type of state reflects Niklas Luhmann’s tendency toward  being abstract, vague, trollishly carnivalesque and—at the same time—  brilliant. The Antinet carries with it such a demeanor. It is one of order, disor -  der, absurdisms, and brilliance—yet the Antinet also contains imperfections.  Its order is not perfect either. A system of perfect order is seen in the digital  realm—with its deterministic, orderly execution of programs that subscribe  to a uniform, predictable protocol. For a glimpse of imperfections and chaos,  one need only review the archive of Luhmann’s notebox, or view his private  home office. 1   In brief, Luhmann’s theoretical work was not developed in an  environment of pure order.  1   holgersen911, Niklas Luhmann—Beobachter Im Krähennest (Eng Sub), 2012, https://  www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRSCKSPMuDc.
82      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Simply stated, the Antinet is not for OCD-individuals who can’t sleep at  night unless their workflow follows some made-up   atomic   protocol. 2  Because Luhmann’s writing was so dry and complex, it leads to confusion  and misinterpretations of what his system actually is. This confusion of what  a Zettelkasten   actually is   continues to spread to this day.  Up until now, those who desired to understand Luhmann’s Zettelkasten in  its purest form were faced with disentangling the prose of Luhmann’s paper  “Communication with Noteboxes.” This paper took me about three weeks to  read and extract into my own Antinet. I spent almost six days a week doing  this; I then spent another month doing the same with Johannes Schmidt’s  paper on Luhmann’s Zettelkasten, and another month perusing the digital  Zettelkasten archives.  Like Luhmann’s books and papers, he left his Zettelkasten system to be under -  stood only by those who invest the time and energy into disentangling his prose.  Most people have not done this. As a result they’ve been left with a surface-level  understanding of what he built. However, if you venture deeper and dig into  what Luhmann really said, one discovers the system to be quite profound. 3  A BRIEF BACKGROUND OF  NIKLAS LUHMANN  Niklas Luhmann was born in Lüneburg, Germany on December 8, 1927.  He was the son of a brewer, though Luhmann himself was disinterested in  drinking. 4 Drinking beer at festivals and the local   Biergarten   was (and still is)  2   By “atomic” I’m referring to the interpretation that Luhmann’s notes were perfectly con -  tainerized units of thought. This is a myth. Luhmann’s notes were streams of thought  that carried over across multiple notecards.  3   One example of this is the fact that Luhmann created the system to use a multiple-storage  architecture—something that has become the dominant model for computers to man -  age memory. Luhmann devised this in the early 1950s before computers were dominant  and before the notion of multiple-storage was widely-accepted.

This also created a barrier to his advancement in his  early career as a civil servant, working for the government.  According to Luhmann’s youngest son, Clemens, Luhmann avoided drink -  ing alcohol throughout his life. Yet, on very,   very   rare occasions, Luhmann  would drink alcohol. When he did it was one glass of red wine. According  to Clemens, the reason his father avoided alcohol was simply this: he didn’t  want to appear stupid! 6  Back to young Luhmann: After a year working at the Lüneburg Higher  Administration Court, Luhmann took another bureaucratic job in Hanover,  Germany. After a year there, and after “problems had arisen, especially in  the area of Nazi reparations,” Luhmann took a different job at the Lower  Saxony Ministry of Culture. 7  It soon became clear Luhmann did not wish to be a mere government  employee. He desired an easy job where he could immediately go home at  five o’clock sharp. He desired this type of work-life balance so that he could  pursue his true passions in the evenings. When asked by an interviewer  what those true passions were, Luhmann replied that his interests at night  revolved around two things: first, reading books, and second, his notebox  system (that is, his Antinet).  During this time Luhmann recalls that he “read a lot.” 8   He read sociology and  philosophy—mainly Descartes and Husserl. In sociology, he was absorbed  by a concept that would stand as a core component of his social theoretical  2011), 121-2.  5   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 153.  6   Clemens Luhmann, Interview by Scott P.

One can browse the notes from  those readings in Luhmann’s online archive. 9  Yet Luhmann spent most of his time in the evenings working with his Antinet.  He did this “above all” other activities. 10  Luhmann’s paradise was reading and conversing with the greatest minds of  humanity. He would read philosophy and sociology, and then reformulate  and reflect on the readings by expressing them on paper via writing by hand  with a pen. After this he would install into his Antinet the thoughts from  these conversations between him and the author he was reading.  Yet one day, early in his career, Luhmann’s paradise would come under  attack. His job became more demanding. Nights spent with his books and  his Antinet were “no longer possible with growing tasks.” 11  One day a senior member of his company sat Luhmann down. Hoping to  advise Luhmann and help advance Luhmann’s career as a civil servant, he  proffered some advice. “You should look into doing some extracurricular  volunteering, and work in a district.” Luhmann replied that he wouldn’t.  “Why?” the senior employee asked. Luhmann replied, “I am reading Hölder -  lin.” 12   Luhmann was referring to Friedrich Hölderlin, a German philosopher  and poet. It was a higher priority for Luhmann to expand his mind than to  expand his career prospects playing the conventional games of bureaucratic  advancement. A short while later, Luhmann would leave the government  job and attend Harvard University.  A brief lesson can be learned from this important point: Luhmann’s vocation  9   “ZK I: Note 80.6 - Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed June 1, 2022,   https://niklas-luh -  mann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_1_NB_80-6_V .  10   Niklas   Luhmann,   Short   Cuts   (English   Translation)   (Frankfurt   am   Main:   Zweitausendeins,  2002), 11.  11   Niklas   Luhmann,   Short   Cuts   (English   Translation)   (Frankfurt   am   Main:   Zweitausendeins,  2002), 11.  12   Niklas   Luhmann,   Short   Cuts   (English   Translation)   (Frankfurt   am   Main:   Zweitausendeins,  2002), 11.
85 N IKLAS   L UHMANN ,   THE   M AN     was reading, thinking, and writing. He turned his   vocation   into his   vacation .  The Antinet did not serve Luhmann as a tool to   replace   this line of work;  instead, it was a tool to   aid   and   enhance   it.  •   •   •  Later on in life, when Luhmann did finally get his dream job working as a  professor at Bielefeld University, he was able to spend his time doing what  he loved: reading, thinking, and writing. At that point Luhmann didn’t  desire fame from his work. He didn’t desire wealth or riches so that he  could spend days bronzing on Caribbean beaches. He instead desired one  thing: “more time.” 13  Luhmann desired more time so he could spend it doing more of what he  loved: reading, writing, and working. When asked of his ultimate Utopia,  Luhmann replied, “I could imagine that for me, the day has thirty hours.” 14  He wanted thirty-hour-long days spent mostly reading, writing, and thinking.  As for Luhmann’s family life, in 1960 at the age of thirty three, Luhmann  married his wife, Ursula. They had three children together and a nice life.  Sadly, she died in 1977, when Luhmann was fifty years old. After she died,  Luhmann never married again. He had a caretaker cook meals and help him  take care of his three children. This enabled Luhmann to focus and continue  spending time on his true passions: reading and his Antinet.  Luhmann’s professional life was a successful one—albeit a rather quiet one.  He is referred to as “the most important German sociologist in the twentieth  century.” 15   Yet he lived a rather simple lifestyle. His routine and workflow  will be covered later in the book. His life revolved around his intellectual  13   Niklas   Luhmann,   Short   Cuts   (English   Translation)   (Frankfurt   am   Main:   Zweitausendeins,  2002), 15.  14   Niklas   Luhmann,   Short   Cuts   (English   Translation)   (Frankfurt   am   Main:   Zweitausendeins,  2002), 15.  15   Undisciplined, Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt, 2021, https://www.youtube.  com/watch?v=kz2K3auPLWU, 19:16.

The “sheer number  [of publications] is unprecedented,” writes one scholar. 16   Luhmann produced  550 academic papers and seventy books in approximately forty years. 17   In his  literary estate, Johannes Schmidt uncovered three thousand manuscripts,  two hundred of which were previously unpublished. 18   As Schmidt puts it,  Luhmann was (with the help of his Antinet) “a publication machine.” 19  LUHMANN’S PHILOSOPHICAL AND  POLITICAL VIEWS  Luhmann was misconceived to be a conservative, right-wing thinker because  he debated Jürgen Habermas, a popular left-wing liberal ideologue. Those  who attended the event say Luhmann dismantled Habermas’s positions,  which resulted in Luhmann becoming “rather famous” in Germany. 20  Yet Luhmann was not a right-wing conservative. His views could be likened  to a   laissez faire   approach to politics and the economy. He could more be  likened to a Libertarian (to use American political terminology). Luhmann  was an ironic character with a stoic demeanor. So too were his political  positions. Perhaps a better description of Luhmann’s political position  could be that of   absurdism , with a trend toward being   carnivalesque.

87 N IKLAS   L UHMANN ,   THE   M AN     mann’s philosophical views were a unique blend of stoicism, Spinozism,  and Daoism. 21   He was always careful to not fall into the trap of moralizing  issues, and practiced being one step removed from established positions  on matters. He desired to avoid the trap of dogmatism, which first starts  with a strong belief in one side being   good , and the other side being   bad .  Luhmann spent a lot of time disciplining his mind so that it could always  remain one thing: detached.  As one author puts it, “[Luhmann was] quite disturbed by ideological  attempts at taking democracy too seriously and thought that such attempts  may paradoxically pose a danger for its existence.” 22  The same could be said of Luhmann’s views toward nationalism (or “love  for one’s country,” as some would deem it). In his opinion, passion could  turn into dogma, which then could turn into storming the United States  Capitol. Having learned from a childhood experience (which will be revealed  shortly), Luhmann was quite reticent about allowing dogma to influence  his thinking. Thus, he remained disciplined in a rational, detached thinking  style. This is worth noting because it would have been quite easy for him to  have gone a different route. One of Luhmann’s greatest influences, Georg  Hegel, was quite an enthusiastic ideologue. 23   It would be easy to conceive  of Luhmann trying to further the ideologies of his mentor; yet, he did not  do such a thing.  Of what can be said of Luhmann’s religious views remains rather brief:  he was not very religious. 24  21   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 116.  22   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 103.  23   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 37.  24   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 37.
88      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  LUHMANN’S THEORETICAL CONCEPTS  There are a series of concepts that continually resurface in Luhmann’s writ -  ings. These concepts were of great importance to his work, and they will be  covered in further detail throughout the book.  One of Luhmann’s cornerstone concepts revolves around   communication .  One of his more frequently quoted statements suggests that “Humans  cannot communicate; not even their brains can communicate; not  even their conscious minds can communicate. Only communication  can communicate.” 25  In light of this, it’s worth considering that the Antinet revolves around  communication. Ideas communicate through being stored in contextual  branches and stems of thoughts. The ideas also communicate with one  another through remote linking to other leaves of thought in the internal -  ly-constructed tree of knowledge.  Communication was not only a pillar of Luhmann’s theoretical work;  it also stands as a pillar of his Antinet. This is why Luhmann titled his paper,  “ Communication   with Noteboxes” [emphasis mine].  Another cornerstone of Luhmann’s theoretical work is   systems theory . This  relates to the field of   cybernetics   and   self-referential systems , which houses  itself in the term   autopoeiesis . 26   This concept is a very interesting one. It’s a  biological concept that Luhmann applied to social sciences. Later on in the  book, I’ll unpack these concepts and explain them in further detail.  SYSTEMS THEORY 2.0  Luhmann’s take on systems theory was not conventional. It could be better  likened to   systems theory 2.0 .  25   Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht and Karl Ludwig Pfeiffer, Materialities of Communication  (Stanford University Press, 1994), 371.  26   Niklas Luhmann, Short Cuts (English Translation) (Frankfurt am Main: Zweitausen -  deins, 2002), 26.
89 N IKLAS   L UHMANN ,   THE   M AN     Systems theory 1.0 revolves around the mereological notion of   whole-part -  theory . In this model, the system equals the whole. The parts are like organs  in a body yet are thought of as more modular and static in nature. When  you think of systems theory 1.0, think simple   input-output   machines (like a  vending machine). You put a dollar in, and it spits out a snack (assuming it  doesn’t get stuck)!  Systems theory 2.0 finds itself in a world of complex interdependent sub -  systems.   Complexity   serves as a cornerstone of Luhmann’s theoretical work  and as such it strongly influenced his notion of systems. The ‘system’, in  Luhmann’s systems theory 2.0, consists of an internal environment that  houses subsystems. The ‘parts’ are actually subsystems, each with their own  complex processes and interactions with their environment. Whereas the  parts in systems theory 1.0 are thought of as modular and static organs, the  parts in systems theory 2.0 are themselves systems, like the cardiovascular  system and immune system in a human body. The parts are essentially their  own complex systems, which are comprised of their own complex systems,  which are comprised of their own complex systems, and on and on. It’s  essentially one big complex fractal of systems and subsystems.
90      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Systems theory 2.0 suggests that the   environment   of the subsystems is provided  by other systems: “Within a complex system, such as the human body, there  are a large number of subsystems that mutually provide the environment  for one another.” 27   One scholar observes that Luhmann’s work in systems  theory raises the question of whether it should be more appropriately named,  “system-environment theory.” 28  In the world of the Antinet, the subsystems are essentially contextual stems  of thought that form around notes. Each of these subsystems cluster together  to form themselves as a subsystem. They also can link to and connect with  other subsystems in remote parts of the Antinet. These clusters of subsystems  create an internal environment in the Antinet that mirrors the chain-linked  structure of how human memory works.  Luhmann devised radical theories that were not conventional and that were  not based on classic sociological concepts. As mentioned previously, Luh -  mann’s intellectual rival, Jürgen Habermas, aimed for his theoretical work to  “improve society by making it communicate more rationally.” 29   Habermas  subscribed to Karl Marx’s famous dictum that philosophy and theory must  not merely analyze the world; it must set out to change it. 30  Luhmann thought such notions futile. In his opinion, ideology packed into  theory and science result in bad science—namely, confirmation bias. His  opinion was colored by the social unrest of the time (1968), and the tendency  of packing ideological political agendas into sociological theories.  Luhmann sought to de-anthropocentrize sociology by exploring what the  field would look like if it did not revolve around people. Rather, he conceived  27   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 128.  28   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 62.  29   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 135.  30   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 25.
91 N IKLAS   L UHMANN ,   THE   M AN     a social system centered on concepts and systems. Luhmann called his  theoretical work “radically anti-humanist,” and “radically anti-regionalist.” 31  By anti-humanist, Luhmann was not implying that he was against human  beings. Rather, he held that anthropocentric models of reality are “unfit  to theoretically describe and analyze communication.” 32   By anti-regional -  ist, Luhmann desired for his theoretical work to be like mathematics; i.e.,  a science that works across cultures. For example, math works in Japan, and  it works just the same in America.  These terms,   anti-humanism   and   anti-regionalist   provide a nice summary of  Luhmann’s thought. 33   The terms are rather alarming at first; yet, when you  peel away the layers and truly understand what they mean, they’re rather  concise and quite profound.  After conducting a comprehensive analysis of Luhmann’s work, one scholar  labeled his theories as   metabiological . “Just as Greek metaphysics explained  the world beyond the physical by applying physical concepts,” one scholar  writes, “Luhmann applied biological concepts for a descriptive analysis of  the nonbiological world and, in particular, society and communication.” 34  In sum, Luhmann’s theoretical work was deep, radical, and widely researched,  spanning many disciplinary fields. By understanding this, one begins to  understand why he structured the Antinet the way he did. It allowed  him to link together and pull from many sources to illustrate his ideas in  great depth.  Understanding this provides ideas for how you yourself may wish to apply  such a methodology to your own disciplinary field. You are undoubtedly  31   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 19.  32   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 131.  33   This serves as yet another reason why the term   Antinet   encapsulates the essence of  Luhmann’s system. It was Anti-convention!  34   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 124.

The Antinet serves as a fantastic sys -  tem to assemble this wide-ranging material in such a way to make it more  straightforward so as to communicate thoughts from your own uniquely  genius ways of thinking.  LUHMANN, THE TROLL  Luhmann was polite, respectful, and sharp; yet he was also a trollish, ironical  character.  One scholar describes Luhmann’s writing style as using “dry, technical, and  conceptual language frequently interspersed with bits of sarcasm, satire,  and parody.” 35  INSTANCES OF LUHMANN’S TROLLISHNESS  Luhmann’s work tends to provoke others and give off a trollish air; yet upon  closer review, it packs wisdom and poses very good points.  As mentioned, Luhmann held that society is composed of internal subsystems  that can affect one another (as they’re related)—like the way a human body  includes the cardiovascular system and immune system. He likens these to  the economic system and political system.  However, Luhmann also held that the subsystems themselves cannot control  one another. Therefore, organizations like the International Monetary Fund  (IMF), and the G8 Summit, which deem themselves to have influence and  control over the economic system function, in Luhmann’s view, in a similar  way to the members of tribal groups who do rain dance rituals. This, accord -  ing to Luhmann, helps the tribe “spread the impression that something is  being done rather than merely waiting until things change by themselves.” 36  35   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 50.  36   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 28.
93 N IKLAS   L UHMANN ,   THE   M AN     That Luhmann posed such an idea was quite the controversial thing to do.  The notion is quite unsettling, especially for the members of the IMF and  G8 Summit who might come across this assertion.  Luhmann, however, was not presenting this notion to divide and humiliate  the people and members of the IMF and G8 Summit (or the tribal members  who dance for rain). He is not claiming they’re irrational or silly, or that  such things should be abolished. Rather, what Luhmann asserted is that  such organizations serve a function in modern society, just as they did in  tribal society. They provide optimism and hope to its members. Even if the  organizations cannot control the future, they give its citizens the impression  they do, which provides optimism for people to press forward. 37  Although Luhmann introduced radical notions (even at the expense of  offending established institutions), he was described as distanced, but  “extremely polite.” 38  Luhmann would politely wait for people to finish making their point, no  matter how confused or absurd the question was. Instead of flatly telling  a person that they were wrong, Luhmann’s replies were softer in manner:  “Of course you can do it that way,” Luhmann would start, “but I would prefer  to start with a different distinction.” Luhmann was very polite in delivering  his message, yet he was also very clear and precise.  THE IRONIC, CARNIVALESQUE SIDE OF LUHMANN  The philosophy underneath the foundation of Luhmann’s troll-like ironic  and smirky demeanor can be described as something I mentioned earlier:  he tended toward the   absurdist   and   carnivalesque .  Yet the result of being an absurdist does not connote becoming filled with  despair (after accepting the notion that life and reality are absurd, even point -  37   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 28.  38   Undisciplined, Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt, 2021, https://www.youtube.  com/watch?v=kz2K3auPLWU, 57:45 and 58:55.
94      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  less). Rather, the reasonable reaction is to be filled with a lightness, knowing  that the world’s complexity is something uncontrollable and unknowable.  One may even feel a sense of joy in knowing this.  Enlightenment thinkers were not of the type to accept such notions. They  possessed comparatively serious dispositions—“Cartesian scientific ‘cer -  tainty’”—with regard to their beliefs in right and wrong. Yet when one adopts  a more open, curious, and awe-filled view of the absurd complexities that  compose reality, one can achieve a lightness of being. 39  Irony is the art and science of paradoxes, that is, dichotomies that arise in  our perceptions of truth. Irony is when something is, at the same time, and  to the same extent, both serious and not serious—both valid and invalid.

It rapidly produces large amounts of well-formed text by  undertaking the comparatively non-rapid process of writing thoughts by  hand. Like Luhmann’s theories, the Antinet is rather ironic and paradoxical  in nature.  LUHMANN, THE BEATLES FAN?  Luhmann wasn’t just a pedantic academic with a certain trollish predispo -  sition. He was plugged in and ‘in-touch’ with popular culture.  For instance, he would use lyrics from   The Beatles   to illustrate his points  (citing “Everybody’s got something to hide, except me and my monkey”  and “Your inside is out, and your outside is in”). He used such quotes to  illustrate the social unrest movement of 1968. 41  Although Luhmann mentioned Beatles lyrics every now and then, according  to Luhmann’s youngest son, Luhmann wasn’t a fan. Luhmann primarily  listened to Louis Armstrong and classical music. 42   For Luhmann, a large  part of being in-touch with popular culture is thanks to the fact that he  lived with his children after his wife passed. “My children are an essential  part of my life,” Luhmann said. “I live here with them and the whole youth  culture around them.” 43  LUHMANN, THE JOKER  A final example of Luhmann’s character can be found in his own Antinet.  On one of his cards, one finds the following note:  In the notebox is a note containing the argument that refutes  the claims on all the other notes.

A joker. 44  I haven’t been able to figure out this riddle. Perhaps the card Luhmann is  talking about is his own internal monologue; his own inner voice, Luhmann  himself—a joker.  CONCLUSION  You now have a taste of the type of character Niklas Luhmann was. You  also have a sense for the theories underlying Luhmann’s research. These are  important aspects to understand. As you’ll soon find out, these properties  are felt within the architecture and nature of the Antinet Zettelkasten.  44 “ZK II: Zettel 9/8j—Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,” accessed February 23, 2022,   https://  niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8j_V .
97  C H A PT E R F I V E  �  WHAT IS AN  ANTINET?  “ H ey boy!” a soldier shouted   at 17-year-old Niklas Luhmann, “stick  out your arm!”  Young Luhmann complied. He stuck out his arm.  Luhmann stood as a prisoner captured along with his friends. They ranged  from fifteen to eighteen years old. One expects they were scared. Yet, instead  of being frightened, Luhmann was one thing: he was hopeful.  “Finally,” one imagines Luhmann thinking to himself, “I’ll be freed of the  glorified slave labor I’ve been forced into for the past several years!”  What happened next would be stamped onto Niklas Luhmann’s psyche—  and also stamped onto his body—for the rest of his life.  The soldier who shouted at Luhmann approached him and got into Luhmann’s  face. Next, the soldier ripped away Luhmann’s wristwatch from his arm. He  then threw Luhmann to the ground. Luhmann was kicked and beaten for what  felt like hours—viciously beaten by the soldier—an American soldier—who  had just hauled in his latest herd of Nazi captives, which included Luhmann.  A detail not often mentioned of Niklas Luhmann, the godfather of the  Zettelkasten notetaking system, is the following fact:   Niklas Luhmann  was, technically, a Nazi .
98      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Yet before wishing upon him   Inglorious Basterds   forehead-carving treatment,  I ought provide you with an additional bit of information: serving in the  Nazi ranks was not Luhmann’s choice.  On January 22, 1943, following the implementation of a decree, the Nazis  enacted an order. The order called for drafting entire school classes of male  students born in 1926 and 1927 into military units. Supervising this program  were two institutions: the Hitler Youth organization and the infamous Nazi  air force, the   Luftwaffe . Because of this order, fifteen-year-old Niklas Luh -  mann (born on December 8, 1927) was forced to join the Nazi ranks of the  Luftwaffenhelfer . These were assistants to the infamous air force of the Nazis. 1  However, at the desperate end of World War II, Luhmann was sent to the  front lines of the war. Shortly after this assignment, he and his comrades  were captured by American soldiers.  Note that Luhmann was   conscripted   into Nazi service. The word,   conscripted ,  basically means one is given the so-called “early honor” to serve their coun -  try, for free, and without pay. It was a government order. They had no say  in this matter.  Toward the end of World War II, the Nazis realized things looked bleak for  them. For this reason, they forced their citizen’s children into slave labor for  their ‘ just ’ cause. These children were   supposed to   have been between the  ages of fifteen to eighteen years. Yet American soldiers reported capturing  Nazi children as young as eight years old carrying guns. 2  1   “ Luftwaffenhelfer .” In   Wikipedia , April 13, 2021.   https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?  title=Luftwaffenhelfer&oldid=1017572660 .  2   Though there were reports that those conscripted into service by the Nazis were even of  much younger age—during World War II, as the Nazi party grew desperate, American  soldiers found children enlisting as young as eight-years-old, and that the Nazis were  equipping them with guns. See, “The History Place—Hitler Youth: Hitler’s Boy Soldiers  1939–1945,” April 22, 2015. https://web.archive.org/web/20150422044533/http://www.  historyplace.com/worldwar2/hitleryouth/hj-boy-soldiers.htm :   “American troops re -  ported capturing armed 8-year-olds at Aachen in Western Germany and knocking out  artillery units operated entirely by boys aged twelve and under.”
99 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     Luhmann did not elect to serve the Nazi cause, and he was not a fan of the  Nazi ideology; however, that didn’t matter. Luhmann had no choice but to  serve the Nazis.  When the American soldiers captured Luhmann, he was beaten as if he were  a Third Reich soldier of the highest-rank.  Yet this most unfortunate experience transformed Luhmann’s thinking pro -  cess in an invaluable way. You see, what made Luhmann such a profound  thinker stems from one thing,   perspective .  As we’ll discuss more in a later chapter, perspective derives from the Latin  roots,   per , meaning “thoroughly and fully,” and   specere , meaning “to observe,  and see, and spectate.” Combined,   perspective   means thoroughly observing,  seeing, and spectating.  Luhmann’s theories encompass some of the most radical perspectives in  the social sciences. His perspectives were shaped by his experience of being  tortured at the hands of American soldiers.  Many people, including myself, tend towards the simplicity of dualis -  tic philosophies. We prefer the simplicity of   good vs. evil . We love   Hero ’ s  Journeys —stories like   Star Wars   and the light side vs. the dark side. Yet,  as Luhmann learned very early and painfully, reality is not so simple. Reality  is often quite complex.  Luhmann discovered this when the Americans captured him and beat him  during the final moments of World War II. On that day, Luhmann (and  his fellow glorified slave-laborers) found themselves hopeful. They were  hopeful that the “coercive apparatus”—the Nazi regime—would wither  away once the Nazis were defeated. 3   Luhmann believed the world reflected  that of   good vs. evil . Even though Luhmann was working for the Nazi party,  3   Niklas Luhmann,   Short Cuts . Orig.-Ausg., 4. Aufl. Short Cuts 1. Frankfurt am Main:  Zweitausendeins, 2002. Page 11.
100      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  he believed the Nazis to be the evil side. After all, they coercively enslaved  him into service, and the Allied powers were thought to be the good side.  Luhmann and his colleagues were quite elated when they were captured.  They were now captured by the good side, soon freed of the Nazi evil they  had found themselves chained to. Once Luhmann and his colleagues were  captured, however, they were ushered like cattle into a room. When the  soldier shouted at Luhmann to hold his arm out, Luhmann extended his  arm as if to embrace his American savior. Luhmann wished to clasp hands  and thank the soldier for rescuing him from the Nazi’s forced labor.  Yet, instead of being embraced with the clasping of hands, the American  soldier ripped off Luhmann’s watch, threw Luhmann to the ground, and  proceeded to beat him viciously. Luhmann’s friends looked on in dismay.  “What the hell’s happening?!” we can imagine Luhmann asking himself in a  state of distress. “I thought the Americans were here to rescue me and to free  me!” Luhmann thought Americans—aka, the good guys—were rescuing him.  It’s rather heartbreaking to imagine the young 17-year-old Luhmann in such a  state. Imagine the painful thoughts racing through Luhmann’s mind. It’s sad  to think of other children like him who experienced the same; children scared  for their lives, suddenly being thrown to the ground and beaten. Luhmann’s  experience was not isolated, either. It happened to many POWs—children  and adults.  Luhmann realized the world was not as simple as the paradigm of   good  vs. evil   during this moment. The world was complex, and the world was  sometimes rather sad.  This life experience led Luhmann to realize that political regimes “could not  run along the axis of “good/evil, but rather that one must judge the figures in  their limited reality.” 4   To be clear, the beatings of Luhmann and his friends  were not permitted by the Allied powers.

101 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     such abuse was supposed to be the Geneva Convention. The Geneva Con -  vention outlined provisions for properly treating prisoners of war (“POWs”).  Its goal centered on protocols designed to treat POWs with   honor and respect . 5  Apparently, the terms   honor   and   respect   were loosely interpreted by the  American soldiers. These soldiers were presumably emotionally exhausted  by the war. Seeing friends suffer and die (in physical form) weighed more  heavily than the Geneva Convention’s rules (which were of metaphysical  form). The Geneva Convention’s   metaphysical   rules seemed purely imaginary  compared to   physical   death.  From the abuse and violence inflicted on Luhmann and his fellow Nazi-  slave-children, Luhmann saw reality as the murky picture it is, perhaps for  the first time in his life.  The lesson in all of this? Simply this: no system is impenetrable to evil acts.  Luhmann viewed Americans as the lesser evil, saying, “The American system,  for example, seems to me the most good.” Nevertheless, Luhmann was not  blind to the systematic problems ingrained in any political system.  Luhmann recognized reality as a complex system mixed with a lot of good  and a lot of bad. He later declared that non-Nazi systems of governance  possess “more positive features and more negative features than any previous  society. So today is both better and worse.” 6  The experience shaped Luhmann so profoundly that he devised a thinking  system for himself, and made sure to architect it in such a way as to challenge  others’ perennial tendency of drifting back into an overly simplistic view of  the world. He needed a system to deter the common tendency of drifting  into simple dualistic suppositions of   good   vs.   evil .  5   “Treaties,   States   Parties,   and   Commentaries   -   Geneva   Convention   (III)   on   Prisoners   of   War,  1949–14—Respect for the Persons and Honour of Prisoners.” Accessed January 4, 2022.  https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/ART/375-590018?OpenDocument .  6   Luhmann.

102      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  It’s “increasingly rare,” Luhmann said, that thoughts or disagreements can  be developed in a useful way if you “moralize” them. 7   Luhmann needed a  system to constantly adapt his   perspective   in such a way as to filter out the  tendencies and biases conducive to falling into the simplicity fallacy—  that of oversimplifying reality.  THE ZETTELKASTEN AS AN ADAPTIVE  OPTIC SYSTEM FOR RAW AND DISTORTED  THOUGHTS  Luhmann needed a tool similar to something called an   adaptive optic system  (in the world of astronomy). This technology is built into telescopes, and  it converts blurry, distorted pictures of the universe into crisp and clear  images. It achieves this by sending the initial light waves it receives, which  are raw and distorted, into a self-correcting feedback loop that measures the  distortions. Next, a critical step happens: the system generates an   inverse  wavefront to compensate for the initial distorted light waves.  The Zettelkasten system works much like an   adaptive optic system . Except  instead of crystallizing raw and distorted light waves,   raw and distorted  thoughts   serve as the materials crystallized.  •   •   •  Now, back to Luhmann’s experience of being tortured by American soldiers.  Let’s wrap up this part of the story.  Shortly after being held in captivity, Luhmann was released. He was one of  the luckier ones simply because he was still seventeen years old. He was not  technically an adult yet. However, the nightmare of American captivity was  not yet over for his friends who had recently turned eighteen. They were  sent to French mines and forced into slave labor and even more beatings. 8  7   holgersen911, “Niklas Luhmann - Observer in the Crow’s Nest (Eng Sub),” 2012, https://  www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRSCKSPMuDc, 18:00.  8   Niklas Luhmann: Society as a System of Communication HANS-GEORG MOELLER 367.

103 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     In his later adult life, Luhmann held these memories in his mind. His the -  ory of society proposes radical notions—such as sociology not necessarily  being about people, but of environmental factors. That is, society is more  ecological than sociological. Also, he held that polar extremes in society  are necessary. These radical views are but one reason Luhmann’s writings  were so complicated and hard to understand. I cover this in more detail at  another point in the book, but in sum, Luhmann’s antithetical ideas were  at risk of triggering uproar; therefore, he was incentivized to package his  complex views with difficult prose. He did this to shield himself from being  read by casual readers.  Luhmann’s Zettelkasten served a critical function in doing this (among many  other things), and would later assist his ideas in gaining notoriety. Eventually  Luhmann became one of the greatest modern social theory thinkers of our  time. His system for managing his theories—the Zettelkasten—informs  and inspires knowledge workers to this day.  Yet there’s one issue emerging today which risks watering down the impact  of the Zettelkasten system Luhmann devised. That’s what we shall talk  about next.  SPECIFIC PRINCIPLES VS. GENERAL  PRINCIPLES  It is my belief that there is a risk to Luhmann’s Zettelkasten system becoming  misinterpreted and thereby morphed into something it is not.  A   principle   is defined as a fundamental truth that serves as the foundation  for a system. 9   Seems straightforward, right? The problem today is that the  specific principles   of the Zettelkasten system that Luhmann himself specified  in his own paper are being cast as   general principles . 10   The   specific principles   of  www.peterlang.com/view/9781453902028/9781453902028.00019.xml.  9   Angus Stevenson, and Christine A.

104      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Luhmann’s Zettelkasten system were cast aside and written off as unneces -  sary and archaic. Luhmann’s system is built entirely of physical, not digital,  parts. With those parts of Luhmann’s system stripped away, deleted, and  morphed from physical form to metaphysical form, the critical essence of  the Zettelkasten system has been demoted. The parts have been deleted  and replaced with analogous abstractions, with the belief that the original  parts were non-critical. In reality, these substituted   parts   are indeed   very  critical   to the   whole !  This entirely different system I’m alluding to is that of digital notetaking apps.  These apps possess functionality enabling one to link notes. Even though  such apps are thought of as a Zettelkasten, the magic that Luhmann built  into his system is lost. Or at the very least, much of the Zettelkasten magic  is replaced by something else entirely.  Digital notetaking apps with note-linking capability are often thought of as  Zettelkasten systems. This is not the case. As a result, people who are newly  curious about Zettelkasten end up hopelessly lost and confused. Or people  end up   thinking   they understand what a Zettelkasten is. They proceed to  take thousands of digital notes before they realize they’re lost and confused.  They’re left with a mess of digital information, and they have no idea why  they even began to take notes in the first place.  I’m not against progress; however, it becomes confusing when a new concept  (i.e. digital notetaking apps with linking capabilities) ensconces itself in a  term used by an entirely different concept (i.e. Niklas Luhmann’s  Zettelkasten).  At the core of this situation rests the delineation of   specific   vs.   general principles .  Let’s first discuss   general principles .  I am not a fan of creating your own instantiation of a system and then refer -  ring to it as if it’s identical to that which it was inspired by.  Take a deep breath, and reread that paragraph.
105 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     OK, now let me give you an example of this. Let’s start with a   wiki . A wiki is  an information source developed collaboratively by a community of users.  It allows any user to add and edit content. 11   If I were to create my own version  of a wiki in physical form, and if, as a result of the different medium, I were  forced to alter and change the essence of how it works, I would hope that  I wouldn’t do one thing—and that is this: I hope I wouldn’t call it a wiki!  Doing so would confuse everyone; I would term the new system (inspired  by a wiki) differently, since it’s new. It is (only) inspired by the concept  of wiki. I also would not force those who still use digital wiki systems to  forever specify that they use   digital wikis   (as opposed to my new   analog  wiki ). Yet this rather absurd illustration is precisely what has taken place  with regards to the Zettelkasten. If you use a physical Zettelkasten system  today, with the same principles that Luhmann used, one is forced to specify  that they’re using an   analog Zettelkasten , or a   Luhmannian Zettelkasten   (as  opposed to a   Zettelkasten —that is, a digital notetaking app with linking  functionality).  Look, I am not against identifying   general principles   and adapting such  principles into more convenient forms in support of your own personal  preferences and goals. Research in knowledge science espouses the view that  “general principles should be adapted by individuals.” Even ancient learned  scholars believed this to be necessary. Early modern Europe produced strict  doctrinaire thinkers. One such thinker was the Jesuit pedagogue, Jeremias  Drexel (1570–1625). Drexel once asserted, “If [the] precepts and rules of  notetaking do not please you, draw up other precepts for yourself, fewer  in number, shorter, suited to your studies, just as long as you take notes.” 12  The question then becomes: in Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten, what stands  as a   general principle   and what stands as a   specific principle ? That is, what could  be altered and eliminated in the name of inspiration, and what is a   specific  principle   that must be strictly adhered to if one were to strive to use the same  system Luhmann used when he used the term   Zettelkasten ?  11   Stevenson and Lindberg, eds.   New Oxford American Dictionary 3rd Edition .  12   Richard Yeo.   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices . Brill, 2016, 139.
106      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  On this matter, I have two beliefs:  First, I believe that   general principles   in a Zettelkasten system are processes—  such as how one takes notes from the materials one reads. So-called   literature  notes   are an example of a   general principle   in a Zettelkasten. Relatedly, the  term   literature notes   is suboptimal.   Literature notes   was a term never used  by Niklas Luhmann, but was popularized by modern authors who loosely  interpret Luhmann’s system. Furthermore, the term   literature note   renders  the types of notes Luhmann took as ambiguous. 13  The bottom line is that the manner in which you take notes while reading  is an example of adhering to a   general principle . Reason being, the process  of taking notes while reading is a   highly personalized activity . The content  you select while reading, and the manner and style in which you   choose   to  extract that selection is highly personalized. How you do it must be adapted  by you. As the scholar, Alberto Cevolini, puts it, “what attracts attention  and is deemed memorable in a book may not be the same for all readers. By  definition, information retrieval is a   selective performance ; in turn, selection  is a highly personalized activity.” 14  My second belief concerns itself with what constitutes   specific principles   in  a Zettelkasten system.  I suggest that there are four principles which are   specific principles   in  a Zettelkasten.  I am not the first to propose that a Zettelkasten consists of four principles.  The first person to do so was Niklas Luhmann himself. He referred to the  principles as   requirements . The second individual to outline its four principles  was Johannes Schmidt, the scholar who perhaps knows Luhmann’s work best. 15  13   Luhmann took different types of notes. Some were word-for-word excerpts (i.e. quotes),  some were notes that were brief observations, and some were summaries in his own  words of what he read. I’ll discuss these types of notes in detail later.  14   Alberto Cevolini, ed.   Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe . Library of the Written Word, volume 53.

107 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     The principles I’m presenting are mapped onto Luhmann’s four principles;  however, in my perfectly biased opinion, they are more simple and useful  in understanding the Zettelkasten. Plus, they form a cool acronym!  Three of the four principles I introduce are referred to by Luhmann as   internal  requirements . One of the four principles he specified was referred to as an  external requirement . 16  It’s worth noting that my views on what stands as a   general principle   vs.   spe -  cific principle   remain an area in which I hold different opinions than others.  Sascha Fast, a leading educator of the Zettelkasten system and who operates  perhaps the most visited website pertaining to the Zettelkasten (zettelkaste.  de), quotes the Israeli fitness trainer, Ido Portal who says, “Principles are  higher than techniques. Principles produce techniques in an instant.” 17   This  quote implies that the four specific principles outlined by Niklas Luhmann  are merely   techniques   that could be adapted and adjusted freely without  worry of compromising the whole.  Fast goes on to outline several principles, such as the “Principle of Atomicity”  which pertains to the idea that one should “put things that belong together  into a single note, give it an ID, but limit its content to that single topic.”   18  Fast’s second principle, labeled the “Principle of Connectivity,” argues for  alternative techniques for implementing two of the principles Luhmann  specifies as internal requirements for a Zettelkasten system, that of (1) “the  possibility of arbitrary internal branching,” and (2) “possibility of linking”  via the numeric-alpha addressing scheme used by Luhmann. 19  com/watch?v=kz2K3auPLWU, 34:00. Johannes Schmidt’s version of Luhmann’s princi -  ples is as follows: (1) a “specific system of organization”, (2) “rules of numbering”, (3)  “internal system of linking”, and (4) a “Comprehensive keyword index.”  16   Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes.”  17   “Getting Started • Zettelkasten Method,” accessed June 28, 2021, https://zettelkasten.de/  posts/overview/.  18   “Getting Started • Zettelkasten Method.” Accessed June 28, 2021.   https://zettelkasten.  de/posts/overview / .  19   Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes,” accessed May 4, 2021, https://luhmann.  surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes; Niklas Luhmann, “Zettelkasten,”, accessed
108      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  I do not hold the first principle (the “Principle of Atomicity”) as a   general  principle   because Luhmann   generally   did not abide by such a principle. One  idea per note is a convenient idea espoused by many people, but it is largely  a myth as it pertains to Luhmann’s system. 20   Yet, for digital Zettelkasten,  I agree with Fast in that it’s probably a useful practice.  The same applies to Fast’s “Principle of Connectivity.” Perhaps it’s a useful  practice for digital Zettelkasten; however, it essentially demotes two of  Luhmann’s core principles (the “internal branching” tree-like structure of  notes, and the numeric-alpha addressing of notes) and passes them off as  mere “techniques.”  The reason this is important to know, and why it’s worthy of your time, centers  on the fact that when too many aspects of a system are relegated to abstrac -  tions, you generalize it so severely that it transforms the original system into  something it is not. It strips away a system’s unique, rough personality and  smooths it down into a watered-down, blurry image of what it once was. The  image you see when you squint your eyes at the Mona Lisa: is it the Mona  Lisa you’re seeing? Or a blurred-out version? More directly, if you define  the principles of a Zettelkasten as something that is founded on   atomicity ,  and   connectivity , then thousands of systems could qualify as a Zettelkasten.  Wikipedia could be considered a Zettelkasten by these principles (even  though it’s not). A website could be regarded as a Zettelkasten in that case.  A thesaurus (with its   See also   references) could be considered a Zettelkasten.  Or, as most people believe, a digital notetaking app with note-linking func -  tionality (via something popularized with the term   wikilinks ), yes definitely  this, could even be considered a Zettelkasten. In the considerable amount  of time I’ve spent working with an analog Zettelkasten—one which adheres  to Luhmann’s four principles—I can say that such a system operates much  August 3, 2021, https://daily.scottscheper.com/zettelkasten/.  20   This idea was popularized by Sönke Ahrens in his book, and has since been spread rap -  idly throughout Personal Knowledge Management communities online.

109 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     differently than any of these things. In other words, Luhmann’s Zettelkasten  system stands apart as an entirely different entity compared with Wikipedia,  websites, thesauri, and digital “Zettelkasten.”  These are but philosophical views; however, I consider it essential to present  the idea that one ought to take seriously the requirements that Luhmann  himself specified. One should take these requirements seriously enough  to at least try them out. I’ve found the four principles to be pivotal in my  experience working with a Zettelkasten.  For the time being, I’ll continue referring to the analog Zettelkasten as a  Zettelkasten; however, in a little bit I’ll introduce the four specific princi -  ples adopted by Niklas Luhmann. After I do this, I’ll be introducing a new  term that I believe encompasses Luhmann’s system more accurately. In the  meantime, the term Zettelkasten shall suffice.  In brief, a Zettelkasten possesses four specific principles. These four princi -  ples define what a Zettelkasten is. However, before I share these principles  with you, I’d like to turn to what a Zettelkasten   is not . Why? Because it helps  demystify the essence of a Zettelkasten in preparation for being introduced  to what it actually is.  Let’s dive into this now.  THE TERM ZETTELKASTEN  I lied. Before I tell you what a Zettelkasten is not, let’s hone in on the term  Zettelkasten   itself.  The term Zettelkasten in American English translates to   notebox . The term  notebox   is the shortened form of a “notecard box.”   Zettel   is the German word  for   note , and   kasten   is the German word for   box .  The reason this is worthy of mention is because of the widespread misin -  terpretation of the term Zettelkasten. When searching the web, one finds  references of it as a “slipbox.”
110      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The reason   slip   is translated from   zettel   stems from a translation defining it  as a   slip of paper . In popular English-German translation dictionaries,   slip of  paper   remains listed but is no longer used as the preferred definition. 21   The  most widely used and arguably the “best among all” translation sources is  one that does not hold   slip   as the most correct term for   zettel . 22   It holds that  the most correct translation for the term   zettel   is simply a   note .  The mix-up with   slip   vs.   note   stems from specifications provided by the  American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”) and the European paper  standards, International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”). 23  The type of paper used by Luhmann is not commonly found in the US.  I know this, of course, because it’s the first thing I tried getting my hands on  after learning what type of paper Luhmann used. It’s tricky to find, but more  tricky is finding cabinets with drawers that can properly store such paper.  The paper size used by Luhmann is ISO’s paper size,   A6 , which is 4.1 inches  by 5.8 inches. According to ISO standard 2784, the American equivalent of  A6 paper is paper sized 4 inches by 6 inches, which are notecards (or blank  index cards). 24  In brief, Luhmann used   zettel   (i.e.   note ) to refer to a   notecard . In other words,  a   zettel   is a   notecard ; Luhmann never used   zettel   in the manner in which  people use it today—which is to connote a digital document containing  text, usually in markdown format.  21   “Zettel—English translation in English—Langenscheidt dictionary German-English.”  Accessed July 17, 2021.   https://en.langenscheidt.com/german-english/zettel .  22   “(4)   Is   Google   Translator   the   Best   among   All?”   Quora.

111 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     In Luhmann’s formative article on his Zettelkasten system, “Communication  with Noteboxes,” Luhmann meant   notebox   as in   notecard box ; he did not  refer to a note as some metaphysical instantiation of a notecard; he would  otherwise refer to that as a   thought .  From this one ought not to discount the importance of notecards—with  their physical properties that include having a static fixed place in space,  and limitations on character-length which they strictly enforce by their size.  One also must not discount the effect these properties had in shaping and  forming Luhmann’s thoughts. Why? Because the medium one uses not only  is   the message, it develops the message. 25  This may seem like dry material, but I assure you, it’s necessary knowledge  if you wish to properly adopt and use a Zettelkasten system and avoid  the landmines you’ll face the second you begin exploring the concept of  Zettelkasten outside this clear canvas I’m about to paint for you. It’s straight -  forward that   Zettelkasten   means   notebox   if you’ve read what I’ve written here.  Be forewarned, however; as soon as you begin surfing the web or watching  YouTube videos, you’ll begin to come upon descriptions of Zettelkasten that  are outdated, misguided, or flat-out wrong (unless you’ve stumbled onto  my YouTube videos, of course)!  Now that you know that   Zettelkasten   translates to   notebox , it’s time to belabor  this matter further by exploring the next topic:   what a Zettelkasten is not .  WHAT A ZETTELKASTEN IS NOT  Zettelkasten does not refer to   any   notebox system. For instance it does not  connote a notebox organized by human-readable top-level concepts or  names, such as the system described by the author Ryan Holiday (which  he adapted from the author Robert Greene). 26  25   “The Medium Is the Message.” In   Wikipedia , November 25, 2021.   https://en.wikipedia.  org/w/index.php?title=The mediumisthemessage&oldid=1057037064 .  26   For instance, a Zettelkasten is not the equivalent found in Ryan Holiday, “The Notecard  System: The Key For Remembering, Organizing And Using Everything You Read.”  RyanHoliday.net   (blog), April 1, 2014.   https://ryanholiday.net/the-notecard-system-  the-key-for-remembering-organizing-and-using-everything-you-read / .
112      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Luhmann makes it clear that what he means by the term   notebox   is not a “mere  container from which we can retrieve what we put in.” 27   When Luhmann  writes of “communication with noteboxes,” he’s not really communicating  with noteboxes but   with what the notebox becomes . What he’s communicat -  ing with, he says, is a system that can “communicate” in the first place. The  benefit of a communication partner is the learning that comes through  not only new information, but through   accidents   and   surprises . We’ll cover  these in detail later on in this book. Accidents and surprises emerge not  via dynamically-structured notecards ordered by topic; rather, the magic  Luhmann writes about emerges from the interplay of four specific principles  he outlines. This is but one reason why   just any   notebox system does not  connote a Luhmannian notebox system.  In brief, a Ryan Holiday notebox system is not a Zettelkasten.  A Zettelkasten is also not the equivalent of a   commonplace book , which is  essentially a notebook organized by topic. The limitations of commonplace  books centers around the following: they only enable short-term knowledge  development. They do not cater to allowing thoughts to evolve over time,  infinitely. They do not allow for the infinite internal branching and expansion  of ideas. One of the four principles of the Zettelkasten (the true Zettelkasten)  enables this expansion. This sets the Zettelkasten system apart from all others.  Let’s hone in for a moment on commonplace books.  I find the people who prefer analog thinking systems are oftentimes those  who greatly value commonplace books. Actually, I think commonplace  books are fantastic thinking systems; yet they pale in comparison to the  Antinet over the long haul.  Commonplace books are closely related to florilegia. These were notebooks  containing religious verses and excerpts grouped by theme. When I refer  to this type of knowledge system I refer to commonplace books. These  types of tools were incredible tools for advancing science and knowledge—  27   Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes”; Luhmann, “Zettelkasten.”
113 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     especially during the Renaissance. One scholar refers to these tools as  “the person-plus-notebook-system.” 28  There are many great thinkers throughout history who used commonplace  books. Thomas Jefferson was an avid user of commonplace books. Dutch  humanist, Desiderius Erasmus (1446-1536) was an ardent advocate of com -  monplace books. 29   Sigmund Freud used a “new kind of notebook, the  ‘wunderblock’ or (magic notepad).” 30   Behind the cool name is the same  thing: a commonplace book.

114      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Yet, there are shortcomings of commonplace books. They embody that of a  “subsidiary memory,” whereas the Antinet is more than this. The Antinet is  a   second mind , an equal. In fact, you’ll oftentimes find yourself humbled by  the knowledge the Antinet surfaces. The idea of the Antinet as something  greater than a subsidiary memory, does not come from myself. It actually  originates from scholars who analyzed both commonplace books and Antinet  Zettelkasten systems. “The florilegium was a type of ‘double memory’ to  which scholars could resort anytime their personal memory failed, the filing  cabinet behaves as a true communication partner with its own idiosyncrasies  and its own opinions.” 31  As one scholar observes, florilegium and commonplace books act as just  another   ego , whereas an Antinet behaves as an   alter ego . It’s no surprise to  learn that Luhmann referred to his own Antinet as an   alter ego . 32  An   ego   is the conscious sense of   self . It’s what you think of when you use  the word ‘I’. 33  When you write down your thoughts in commonplace book or Moleskine  notebook, you see yourself in them. It’s a linear version of yourself. It’s less  chaotic in nature usually because each page is closely related in time.  An   alter ego   is a second identity. It’s a second mind that exists metaphori -  cally. 34   The alter ego exists either as a substitute or a representative of your  mind, yet it possesses unique characteristics. It possesses its own unique  personality. Think of Superman, compared with his alter ego, Clark Kent.  31   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016),  28-29.  32   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

115 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     The Antinet is more of an alter ego. It develops its own unique personality  whom you communicate with.  An Antinet is not a collection of excerpts, quotes, kindle highlights, or flori -  legia. It’s something more complex than these types of devices. The Antinet  is not a subsidiary memory; it’s a second mind.  In brief, if you’ve ever kept a notebook containing your thoughts and readings,  and organized them by category, that’s not a Zettelkasten system, nor is it  something which I believe you’ll ever want to go back to once you begin  using a Zettelkasten.  I won’t cover the advantages and disadvantages of such systems here; just  for now, know that they’re quite different from a Zettelkasten system.  WHAT A ZETTELKASTEN SYSTEM IS  I hold, like Niklas Luhmann held, that his notebox system is built on four  specific principles. One of the principles (or requirements) is   external  according to Luhmann, which means it lives in physical reality. The other  three principles are   internal   concepts, which means that they are more meta -  physical in nature—though they are present within the physical principle.  THE FOUR PRINCIPLES OF A (TRUE) ZETTELKASTEN  Principle #1: Analog  The first principle is what Luhmann referred to as an   external   requirement for  a Zettelkasten. By   external , Luhmann meant it’s something that is physical  in nature: “Wooden boxes, which have drawers that can be pulled open,  and pieces of paper.” 35  Luhmann referred to this principle as a   mere externality ; however, he referred  to it as   mere   for good reason. At the time there was no metaphysical, internal  way of memorizing knowledge other than resorting to the mnemonic tech -  niques. Such techniques were used by ancient Greek thinkers like Socrates.  This involved mapping metaphysical thoughts onto physical items present  35   Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes”; Luhmann, “Zettelkasten.”
116      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  in either a literal or an imagined room or space. The physical objects acted  as   cues   allowing one to better   recall   any   thought   stored in memory.  Believe it or not, at the time when learned scholars and thinkers began to  transition from such mnemonic techniques (which are metaphysical in  nature) to notes stored in physical materials (such as was tablets, and later on,  paper), it was met with much resistance—even Socrates himself, we learn  by way of his followers, derided the emerging popularity of taking physical  notes. 36   Plato echoed the same sentiment as Socrates: “According to Plato,  the true learned man should rather be autonomous. He should not ask for  help coming from the outside; instead, he should be able to help himself,  especially in face-to-face interactions.” 37   Yet Plato also began adopting the  idea of storing thoughts in physical materials. His tool of choice was the  wax tablet. 38  In my opinion, using physical materials to work with knowledge unlocks  some of the most powerful results. Later in the book, I detail why I believe  the analog component to be so important. I will also share research and  specific illustrations showing why physical materials are so critical to devel -  oping knowledge. To that end, Luhmann did not need to specify   analog   as  a requirement over   digital . Why? Because digital tools were not an option  when he started building his Zettelkasten. I have reason to believe that  if Niklas Luhmann were alive today he would continue using his analog  Zettelkasten. There’s magic within the analog medium incapable of being  reproduced in digital tools. I will share why I believe this to be the case  later on in this book.  36   Ann M. Blair,   Too Much to Know: Managing Scholarly Information before the Modern Age ,  First Edition (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2011), 78.  37   Cevolini, ed.,   Forgetting Machines , 1.  38   Related note: I ended up purchasing a wax tablet to experience what it would’ve been  like for Plato in developing his knowledge. I found it surprising how useful the tool is;  it’s almost like a portable whiteboard. However its key differences are: 1) its more pain -  ful to write knowledge down so you must be very deliberate in thinking before you write,  2) the limitation of space forces you to be very concise (and thus err on the side of writ -  ing down short words, or   cues , that trigger a longer thought).
117 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     Principle #2: Numeric-alpha Notecard Addresses  Perhaps the most important principle in Luhmann’s notebox system is  that of the   numeric-alpha   notecard addresses.   Numeric-alpha   refers to card  addresses which start with a number and then are combined with alphabetical  characters to branch down and internally expand to an infinite degree. This  simple practice creates a self-referential object for every single one of your  thoughts . This enables what Luhmann phrased, “the possibility of linking.” 39  Linking thoughts is the very thing which enables the system to become  self-referential in nature, a   cybernetic   network as Luhmann thought of it. 40  What is meant by   addresses   should also not be overlooked. In the first  Zettelkasten Luhmann created in the 1950’s, he used a convention that  employed commas for separating his different branches of thought in his  Antinet. For instance, his notecard “5,1A” contained an excerpted quote by  an author. 41   In Luhmann’s second Zettelkasten, which was built specifically  to help him with his thirty-year-long undertaking to create a unified theory  of everything as it applies to society, he used a mix of slashes and periods  and commas. For instance: ‘21/1,1’. 42   I simply use the numeric-alpha scheme  combined with slashes (I do not use commas or periods as separators). For  instance: ‘27/2 a /12’. I’ve yet to find it necessary or natural to use periods or  commas. Regardless, we’ll explore in detail the specific schemes and practices  of building your own Antinet later in the book. The beauty of the system is  that there’s not a strict computer science protocol. There’s no scheme you  must adhere to in order to work with the system. You can mold it and work  with it in the way your brain most prefers (as long as you operate within the  framework of the four principles I’m introducing now)!  Now back to the concept of   card addresses   for a moment. When people first  see a card address like, ‘27/2 a /12’ they immediately think it adheres to a  39   Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes.”; Luhmann, “Zettelkasten.”  40   “ZK II: Note 9/8—Niklas Luhmann Archive.” Accessed January 10, 2022.   https://  niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8_V .  41   “ZK I: Note 5.1a—Niklas Luhmann Archive”” accessed January 11, 2022,   https://  niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_1_NB_5-1a_V .  42   “ZK II: Zettel 21/1,1—Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,” accessed January 11, 2022,   https://  niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_21-1-1_V .
118      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  hierarchical structure. The address does not indicate a hierarchy, however.  It’s merely the   location   of where the leaf lives on a branch of your tree. Think  of it more like a   geographic coordinate system , like latitude and longitude (for  instance ‘-77.0364,38.8951’). The periods do not connote a hierarchy; the  address ‘27/2A/12’ could simply be represented as ‘27.2A.12’, and that would  be just fine. It’s a matter of personal preference.  Anyway, we’re in the weeds here. Much about numeric-alpha addresses will  be covered later on in this book. For now, just know that this is perhaps the  most important principle of Luhmann’s four principles. It also happens to be  the principle that people   overthink   the most, too! Assigning a numeric-alpha  address to a notecard paralyzes people. It can be the thing that kills your  progress. This all stems from one’s internal tendency towards perfectionism.  Digital notetaking tools have trained many to be perfectionists (even at the  expense of being productive). This tendency is something we’ll be fixing.  With the Antinet you’ll learn to focus on what really matters: developing  knowledge (not cutesy bubble graphs displaying connected digital notes).  I’ll be teaching you to major in the major (instead of majoring in the minor).  Don’t worry, I’m here to help in your recovery.  Again, the importance of numeric-alpha addresses cannot be emphasized  enough. It not only enables linking, it enables the self-referential composition  of the Zettelkasten which gives it a unique   personality . Luhmann holds this  as one of the most important aspects of the system. The unique personality  stands as the raw material which will help the Zettelkasten morph into an  unexpected structure allowing you to   communicate   with the   second mind , the  doppelgänger , the   ghost (or spirit, or mind) in the box , as Luhmann referred to  it. 43   This is the entity Luhmann was suggesting would communicate when he  titled his paper, “ Communication with Noteboxes .” Numeric-alpha addresses  make this possible.  43   “ZK II: Note 9 / 8.3 - Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed January 11, 2022,   https://niklas-  luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8-3_V .
119 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     Principle #3: Tree  The third principle Luhmann specifies is a structure that allows for “the  possibility of arbitrary internal branching.” 44  Luhmann realized early on in life—thanks partly to his experiences being  tortured by the so-called   good guys   at the end of World War II—that the  world is not so simple. It’s quite complex. Reality resolves to nature, which  resolves to chaos. If scientists seek to discover and publish the truth, then it’s  necessary to accept chaos. Life is not a simple dualistic affair, as Luhmann  discovered. It’s not always one of   good vs. evil . The world is complex, and  so is the human mind.  With this understood, the question then becomes: how can one devise a  system built on that which best models reality? Reality is chaos, yet it also  emerges from ordered and simplistic rules (think the laws of thermody -  namics). Reality (chaos) also emerges from simplistic parts (for instance,  the atomic theory posits that matter is composed of particles called atoms).  Reality is chaos built out of simple laws of order, and units of order. These  simple laws and units of order bind the system together, allowing one to  navigate complexity. It was with this in mind that Luhmann crafted his  notebox system.  Within the current popularity of communities forming around Personal  Knowledge Management (“PKM”) systems, it’s become a popular idea to  embrace so-called   dynamic   systems—ones that are   fluid   and are built on  things like   wikilinks , and   tags . An idea taught in the popular PKM course,  Linking Your Thinking , preaches this idea in dogmatic fashion: “Folders are  rigid and exclusionary by their nature. Whatever is in a folder lives separated  from the main collection. It’s a rigid hierarchy that imposes order.” 45   This  notion, however, is mere pop-productivity opinion. Luhmann’s Zettelkasten  44   Niklas Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes by Niklas Luhmann,” trans.  Manfred Kuehn, accessed May 4, 2021, https://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-  with-slip-boxes.  45   “1c.3 Using Folders—LYT Curriculum / Unit 1—PKM & Idea Emergence,” Linking Your  Thinking, accessed October 25, 2021,   https://forum.linkingyourthinking.com/t/1c-3-  using-folders/142/2 .
120      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  was not   dynamic , nor was it   fluid . It could be argued that it was built entirely of  folders (in the digital computer directory sense). The reason why a dynamic,  fluid structure is one you ought not to strive for centers on the following fact:  such a structure would be lacking in rough, unique conventions. It would  lack a unique personality, which is what Luhmann’s system optimized for.  In brief, it would not mirror the systems found in nature.  Simply stated, Luhmann’s Zettelkasten structure was not   dynamic   or   fluid   in  nature. Yet, it was not   rigid , either. Examples of a   rigid   structure are classifica -  tion systems like the Dewey Decimal System, or Paul Otlet’s massive notecard  world museum known as   The Mundaneum . These types of systems are useful  for   interpersonal knowledge systems ; however, they’re not illustrative of what  Niklas Luhmann’s system was: an   intrapersonal knowledge system . Luhmann’s  notebox system was not logically or neatly organized in a way that allowed  for convenient public access. It was pure chaos to anyone (other than its  creator) who perused its contents. In other words, Luhmann’s Zettelkasten  was not a structure that could be characterized as one of   order .  In brief, Luhmann’s notebox system was not   dynamic   and   fluid . Yet it was  not one of   order , either.  So what are we to think of Luhmann’s notebox system? In my experience  using it, I find it to be more   organic   in nature. Like nature, it has laws and  rules by which it operates; yet, it’s also subject to complete and total   random  choice. We know this because in describing it, Luhmann uses the word   arbi -  trary   to describe its   arbitrary internal branching.   Defined,   arbitrary , means  something that is decided   randomly   on personal whim. 46   This   arbitrary ,  random   structure contributes to one of its greatest aspects—the aspect of  surprises . Even though I’d call it an   organic   structure, that term seems rather  trite. Other ways you can think of it is as a   molecular   structure, or an   atomic  structure. Yet, in recent time, concepts like   atomicity , as I’ve touched on,  have been overused and abstracted unnecessarily. Sure,   atomicity   could be  considered a property of the Zettelkasten, but it could be argued   atomicity  is a property of nearly everything that is composed of matter!  46   Stevenson and Lindberg, eds.,   New Oxford American Dictionary 3rd Edition .
121 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     Let’s not get carried away, however. Let’s jump back to the question: how  are we to think of Luhmann’s notebox system?  It’s actually quite simple, and I’ll share with you precisely how you should  think of the Zettelkasten in just a moment. Until then, it’s important to close  the loop on the characteristic which describes it.  One of the scholars who studied Luhmann’s Zettelkasten closest is the  researcher Johannes Schmidt from Bielefeld University in Germany. Biele -  feld is the same university Luhmann worked at, and where he used his  Zettelkasten to devise his impressive social theoretical work. It’s no coin -  cidence that Schmidt knows Luhmann’s system so well. Schmidt has spent  countless hours sifting through Luhmann’s notebox card-by-card in person.  He’s currently the scientific coordinator of the project to digitize Luhmann’s  notebox and publish its contents online for all to explore. 47   According to  Schmidt, Luhmann’s notebox system is “a rough structure.” 48   It’s organized  “by subject areas, which is reflected in the first number assigned to the card.” 49  The characteristic which describes a Zettelkasten is simply this: it’s a   rough  structure   that consists of both “order and disorder.” 50  Now that we know the characteristic of a Zettelkasten not as a   dynamic ,   fluid  structure, nor a structure of complete   order , we can think of it as a   rough  structure. Yet, knowing this gets us only so far. Knowing the abstract char -  acteristic of a system is nice, yes, but not really that useful in practice. For  this reason, I’ll share with you what I’ve found to be the best illustration of  what type of structure a Zettelkasten is.  47   “PEVZ: Johannes Schmidt - Contact (Bielefeld University),” accessed January 11, 2022,  https://ekvv.uni-bielefeld.de/perspubl/publ/PersonDetail.jsp?personId=25653450 .  48   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,”   Forgetting Machines.

122      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Think of a Zettelkasten as a tree. A real tree. Not a tree that is platonic in nature.  Not a diagram of a tree. Not a tree directory structure that you think of in  computer science. Rather think of the Zettelkasten as an actual tree. What  does an actual tree contain? It contains a trunk, branches, stems, vines, and  leaves. We’ll go into detail on this later on in the book; but for now, think  of each individual leaf as a notecard. With a Zettelkasten, you’ll be building  trees of knowledge, one that has different trunks, different branches, different  stems of thoughts, and even vines that link to other branches, allowing you  to explore and swing between branches and trees.  The importance of the Zettelkasten’s tree-like structure should not be  overlooked. Human memory works in a way that closely models tree-like  structures. Even physically, the human brain, neurons, and neural networks  follow branching structures. Some of the most beautiful tree-like images are  the networks of the human brain: “If each nerve cell enlarged a thousand  fold looks like a tree, then a small region of the nervous system at the same  magnified scale resembles a gigantic, fantastic forest.” 51  The structure of your second mind (which is what a Zettelkasten, if built  properly, will create) is critically important. It’s not just about storing infor -  mation and creating cool bubble graphs of notes that link together (that’s  what digital tools focus on); rather, it’s about   exploration , as one scholar put  it. The tree structure of the Zettelkasten enables meaningful exploration, as  Alberto Cevolini points out: “secondary memories themselves have an inner  order that allows for   exploration .” 52  Later we’ll be exploring the   tree   structure of Luhmann’s Zettelkasten in  more detail. We’ll be exploring how to think of it. More practically, we’ll be  exploring how to   leverage it   to help you develop and evolve your knowledge  over time.  51   For beautiful images and more exploration on this subject, see: Giorgio A.

123 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     Principle #4: Index  The last principle in Luhmann’s notebox system is the   index . Luhmann calls  this concept a “Register.” 53   I prefer   index , but you’re welcome to use whatever  terminology you like best. You can think of the index as a   map . It’s your map  for exploring your own   tree of knowledge .  Say you’re traveling, staying in a new location and suddenly you realize you  haven’t eaten all day. You’re starving. You think to yourself,   I’m really craving  In-N-Out Burger right now . You recall seeing an In-N-Out Burger the previous  day, but since you’re traveling, you’re not sure how to get there. You pull out  your phone, open your maps app, and then what do you do? Do you type  in the latitude-longitude coordinates ‘32.7794303,-117.242262’? Or, instead,  do you type in the human-memorable name known as ‘In-N-Out Burger’?  Chances are you opt for the human-memorable name. This is precisely  how to think of the index for your Zettelkasten. The index is a key-value  associative array. They   keyterm   is the human-readable name, and the   value  is the location of the leaf on a tree in your Zettelkasten. For instance, here’s  an example taken directly from my Zettelkasten: “Truth”: ‘5455/1’.  If you’re a software developer or programmer, and you’re familiar with data  structures like JSON, or Python dictionaries, or YAML arrays, you can get  pretty advanced with your index. You can create nested items of key-value  pairs. If you’re not a nerd (or a wannabe nerd, like me), then don’t worry  about this stuff. We’ll cover keyterms and the index in detail later on (and  you won’t have to be a computer nerd to understand it).  The bottom line is this: think of the index as your own map that enables you  to swing onto a certain leaf, on a certain branch of a certain tree. From there,  you can then continue   exploring   by reviewing the nearby stems of thoughts  and the individual cards which, themselves, contain remote links. These  remote links enable you to swing around to other leaves on other branches  of your tree of knowledge. More on this will be revealed later in the book.  But for now, you’re ready to be introduced to what an Antinet is composed of.  53   Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes.”; Luhmann, “Zettelkasten.”
124      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  INTRODUCING “THE ANTINET”  To summarize, these are the four principles of a Luhmannian Zettelkasten:  1.   it is   A nalog;  2.   it uses   N umeric-alpha Addresses;  3.   it has a   T ree Structure;  4.   and an   I ndex.  The first letters of each of those four things (“ A ”, “ N ”, “ T ”, “ I ”) are what  make it an   Anti net .  Many people, when first coming across the term   Antinet,   may mistake it for  being   anti-digital , or   anti-technology . This misinterpretation is something  I understand, and frankly, something I take delight in. I snicker at the idea  of ruffling people’s feathers because there’s a part of me that is a troll, just  as Niklas Luhmann himself was.  The consequences of this aren’t the most pleasant, however. In my very early  days sharing this knowledge, I was met with much resistance. In online forums  whenever I answered Zettelkasten questions (from an analog perspective),  I received polarized reactions. That is, I tended to receive a healthy supply  of upvotes, and a heavy supply of downvotes. That’s fine with me. I deserved  it; however, if you spent some time reading what I actually said, I was not  as anti-digital as one would think.  To be clear, I am anti-digital when it comes to a knowledge development  system such as the Antinet; but within reason. I understand that some  people may operate and think better with digital tools. That’s fine. In my  book you’ll find a section for those who refuse to give up digital media for  working with knowledge. It’s a compromised version—I strongly believe  that—but it may be useful for some. However after you read the science  and rationale for an   analog   knowledge development system, I’m confident  you’ll at least give such a system your best shot first.  Now that I’ve explained what   Antinet   stands for, I will be using the term  Antinet   as the primary term through the remainder of this book (instead of
125 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     Zettelkasten ). Here and there I’ll drop in the term Zettelkasten; but my pre -  ferred term is Antinet. I choose to do this because today the term   Zettelkasten  connotes digital notetaking apps with linking capabilities. Also, the reason I  don’t just use the term   notebox system   is because it’s already used for systems  that simply store notecards categorically. 54  Before we move on, there’s one last thing you should know. It pertains to  the   net   in   Antinet .  The “Net” in “Antinet”  The   net   in   Antinet   refers to   network . To Luhmann, the system he built was  a   cybernetic network . It was   self-referential   in nature because of its ability to  cross-reference its contents through the   numeric-alpha   addresses. 55  Luhmann, familiar with how human memory worked, understood how  the brain is structured—as a network, just as we know it today— a network  that possesses approximately 100 billion neurons and 200 trillion connections . 56  •   •   •  Now that you know the four principles of the notebox network Luhmann  designed, you’re closer to understanding it. But there’s only one problem:  you now know   what   an Antinet is, but you still have no idea what an Antinet  really   is. The four principles describe the   parts   of Luhmann’s system. They  describe its fundamental raw “atomic” material. They do not describe the  whole   it creates—and trust me, the four parts do combine to create a whole  greater than the sum of its parts.  54   As, for instance, seen in Holiday, “The Notecard System.”   RyanHoliday.Net   (blog), April  1, 2014.   https://ryanholiday.net/the-notecard-system-the-key-for-remembering- orga -  nizing-and-using-everything-you-read/ .  55   “ZK II: Note 9/8 - Niklas Luhmann Archive.” Accessed January 10, 2022.   https://niklas-  luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8_V .  56   Michael Jacob Kahana,   Foundations of Human Memory .   (New York: Oxford University  Press, 2014), 30.
126      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  When the four principles are combined into a system, the Antinet becomes  a   thinking tool , a   communication partner , and a   second mind . They combine  to produce many other novel phenomena, such as insightful   surprises   by  way of ordered   randomness . The Antinet becomes a system where   thought   is  developed—both in the short term (by way of writing by hand, and thinking  on paper) as well as the long term (by its branched architecture that stamps  things in time that are most useful later on: this includes mistakes in your  own thinking that are stamped in time, which will prove valuable). Also  stamped in time is your own mind, and its own context, with its own links  (that one thinks of at the time of writing and developing   thought ). In brief,  there’s a   temporal   context which is stamped and installed into your Antinet.  This context, this inner voice, if you will, then develops into a   second mind  enabling you to communicate with it, and in Luhmann’s terms, to ask it  questions. It is the combination of all four principles which transform the  Antinet from a mere notebox into a   second mind . 57  Magic takes place when the four principles interact in the Antinet. Johannes  Schmidt observes that, when the four principles of an Antinet are combined,  “all of them together create a complex cognitive system.” 58   This is accomplished,  through the four principles, in several ways:  1.   The   neuroimprinting   on the mind via its   analog   medium of writing by hand.  2.   The “(selective) relations” between notes enabled via the   numeric-alpha  addresses . 59  3.   The “special filing technique”, with its   infinite internal branching   via the  tree structure. 60  4.   The   index , which enables you to neuro-imprint ideas and cues in human-  memorable language.  57   It’s become a marketing idea of late to refer to a system that stores information as a   sec -  ond brain ; yet, that’s not really what you want, nor is that even a good term for what  you’re developing with an Antinet. What you’re building is a second   mind . In the schol -  arly field, this idea is often referred to as an   extended mind . More on this concept later.  58   Undisciplined, “Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt.”  59   Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool,” 309.  60   Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool,” 309.
127 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     All of these four elements interact and create unexpected effects, including  reverberation—as it’s called   in the science of human memory—allowing you  to retain more knowledge and connections than you ever thought possible.  You’ll begin to notice yourself reading differently. Certain index keyterms  arise while reading; all you have to do is write the keyterm down on a note -  card (called a “bibcard”). This is what Luhmann did.  As it relates to the four principles,   this structure , as Johannes Schmidt observes,  demonstrates how quickly   the Antinet sets you on a path away from what  one would deem   ordered   (and taxonomically sound). Although seemingly  nonsensical, to the creator—that is, to you—the Antinet becomes perfectly  natural to understand. One is   led away from the original topic and to a vari -  ety of other subjects—ones that would not have initially been associated with  one another . 61   All of these incommunicable experiences are formed by the  structure of the Antinet’s four principles.  The   whole   of an Antinet is incommunicable—meaning, you’ll need to  understand it yourself by experiencing it yourself. Don’t worry, though.  I’ll be showing you   precisely   how to build your own Antinet a few chapters  from now. Until then, I’d like to share with you a little bit more about what  an Antinet   really   is.  WHAT AN ANTINET REALLY IS  An   Antinet , defined, is composed of four principles which form a   knowledge  system   (as well as other systems) which in turn, transforms itself into a  second mind .  From this definition, it may not seem like much, but there’s a lot to unpack  here. Unpacking this definition is what I’ll be doing in this section. My  goal centers on two things: first, to give you a glimpse of the metaphysical  experience in working with an Antinet; and second, to do so in a way that  isn’t boring as hell. Sound good? Let’s get started.  61   Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool,” 309.
128      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  THE FUNDAMENTALS OF KNOWLEDGE  DEVELOPMENT  We’ll be discussing the concept of   knowledge development   later. First, though,  we need to understand the fundamental raw material of what we’re even  working with as   knowledge developers . The best place to start is merely with  the question,   What is a thought?  What Is a “Thought”?  The best way to understand what an Antinet   really   comes from asking what  it   contains .  What does an Antinet actually contain? Notes, yes. But what does a note  contain? There are many types of notes, yes. But for all intents and purposes,  a note contains one thing: a   thought .  The latest research in cognitive neuroscience shows that the average person  experiences 6,200 thoughts per day. 62   Many of these thoughts are useful, yet  they need some time to develop. They need what Luhmann referred to as  rumination   in order to sprout and grow. Unfortunately, most thoughts never  have the chance to ruminate. Even if captured digitally, thinkers rarely under -  take the practices necessary to sort and make use of all the information they  encounter. Why? Simply because they quickly find themselves drowning in  too much information (and as a result, too many thoughts). In other words,  we experience   thought overload —and this is especially the case for thoughts  enmeshed in digital workflows.  The problem of   thought overload , however, is the very thing Luhmann figured  out how to solve. By way of metaphor, Luhmann’s Antinet transforms one’s  mind into a persistent, supercharged version of itself. Luhmann devised a  knowledge structure for his thoughts which transformed his mind—and  he admitted he was not naturally very proficient at remembering thoughts.  62   “Discovery of ‘Thought Worms’ Opens Window to the Mind,” Queen’s Gazette | Queen’s  University, July 13, 2020,   https://www.queensu.ca/gazette/stories/discovery-thought  -worms-opens-window-mind .
129 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     Luhmann desired to create a   marcescent   tree of knowledge. A   marcescent   tree  is one which never loses any of its leaves. It’s a phenomenon in nature. Like  the leaves of a marcescent tree, Luhmann created a mind that never loses  thoughts. Indeed, the Antinet is a mind that never loses its thoughts. It’s a  marcescent tree. The only risk is if it catches on fire or is destroyed (which  is something I’ll address later in this book).  OK, let’s now address the question:   What actually is a thought in the first  place?!   For this answer, let’s turn to the dictionary for help.  Perhaps the world’s biggest trolls are those working at Merriam-Webster who  devised the definition for the word   thought . By their definition, a thought  is   something that comes from thinking . 63   How profound. If you look up the  word   thinking , you’ll learn that it’s   something a mind does to produce thoughts . 64  What we’re left with is a circular reference that doesn’t tell us very much.  Thankfully from the land of psychology emerges a definition of   thought  that is of more use: a   thought   is simply a representation of reality. 65   In other  words, a thought is a reflection or observation of reality. Such things are  what you write down on a notecard. Its aim is to represent some aspect of  reality (physical or metaphysical reality).  Your thoughts do not live in an isolated universe. They’re shaped by several  dimensions, which are constantly changing over the course of your life.  Thoughts are a product of   self ,   space ,   time ,   reverberation   (recent behaviors  and interests), and   content   (current context). These five dimensions stand  essentially as a   container   which shapes a   thought . More on this will be written  about later in the book. For now it’s worth knowing that one of the core  63   “What Actually Is a Thought?

130      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  strengths of an Antinet is its ability to preserve not just the   thought   itself,  but the   container   of dimensions in which a thought is formed.  What Is a ‘Memory’?  Great, now you know that a   thought   is. It’s your mind’s representation of  reality. You also know that it’s shaped by several dimensions.  The next question is,   what’s a memory ?  Before answering this question, one must delineate between   a memory , and  memory   (as in   human memory ). We’ll start with what   a memory   is.  Put simply,   a memory   is a stored representation of a   thought . Like a   thought,  your memories are also a function of several dimensions which shape it.  Scientific experiments in the study of human memory show that different  brain regions process different dimensions attributed to a memory. This  model of memory is called the   attribute model of memory . To reiterate, the  attribute model of memory asserts a view in which different brain regions  process different dimensions of a memory. Like the dimensions of   thought ,  the dimensions attributed to a memory include variables like space, time,  sensory perceptions, and emotional aspects. 66  What Is ‘Human Memory’?  Now we know what a   thought   is, and what   a memory   is. There’s only one more  thing we ought to get on the same page about before trying to understand  what an Antinet   really   is.  But first, now is a good time to take a step back for a moment. Let’s answer the  question of why it’s even important to understand what an Antinet   really   is.  The reason it’s important is that by learning how   knowledge development  works, your own thinking, researching, and publishing output will be greatly  enhanced. Even if you decide that building an Antinet is not for you, you  66   “Attribute Model of Memory—APA Dictionary of Psychology,” accessed  November 8, 2021, https://dictionary.apa.org/attribute-model-of-memory.
131 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     can still greatly benefit from learning these concepts. Got it? Good. Let’s  jump back into the fundamentals of knowledge development ( thought ,  a memory , and   human memory ).  The last thing you ought to know centers around what   human memory   is.  The reason   memory   can be a confusing concept centers on the fact that   a  memory is different from plain ol’   memory .   The term   memory   refers to  the collective process of encoding, storing, and retrieving   a memory .  Now that we know that   a memory   is a stored representation of a   thought ,  and a   thought   is your mind’s representation of   reality , effectively,   human  memory   is your mind’s ability to encode, store, and retrieve represen -  tations of reality.  This is a greatly simplified conceptualization of   human memory . Why? Sim -  ply because human memory is one of the last major unknowns in the field  of neuroscience. Human memory is still a mystery. 67   In my opinion, this is  very exciting. Richard Feynman, the revered American theoretical physicist,  observed it as “a very important problem which has not been solved at all.” 68  Luhmann was familiar with how human memory works. He understood it  not as something composed of one thing; rather, he knew it as something  composed of trillions of connections built on   association . The concept of  association   shall be discussed later in the book. According to Richard Yeo,  memory isn’t something that happens in the brain alone. It’s more complex  than that. Memory is “often distributed across heterogenous systems com -  bining neural, bodily, social, and technological resources.” 69  There are different lenses and models scholars use to study human memory.  I won’t get into them now, nor will I get into the pros and cons of each. The  tendency to overcomplicate things plagues the disciplinary field of human  67   Kahana,   Foundations of Human Memory , 31.  68   Kahana,   Foundations of Human Memory , ix.  69   Cevolini, ed.,   Forgetting Machines , 129.
132      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  memory studies (and, let’s be honest, many academic fields as well). Often,  scholars fall prey to the complexity cognitive fallacy. They overcomplicate  ideas, filling them with unnecessary technobabble when trying to explain  something even they don’t understand yet. 70   This is why, for now, and for our  purposes, the simple definition of human memory I laid out previously will  more than suffice in aiding our understanding of what an Antinet   really   is.  Before moving on, here’s a summary of the three fundamental components  of   knowledge development   we’ve just learned:     A   thought   is your mind’s representation of   reality .     A   memory   is a stored representation of a   thought .     Human memory   is the collective process of encoding, storing, and retriev  ing   a memory .  What Is “Reality”?  For the sake of moving forward, I’m tempted to dive right into addressing  what an Antinet   really   is; however, I simply can’t.  Here’s why: if you review the definitions of the three concepts I’ve laid  out previously, there’s one concept I haven’t properly addressed yet. That  concept is,   reality .  I bet you didn’t think you’d be faced with the question   what is reality?   when  you began reading about something called an ‘Antinet’; but alas, here we are.  I’m not going to dive too deeply into the solving of the question of   reality  right now, but I’ll give you a better understanding than you might otherwise  have had. In brief, no two people share the same reality ( it’s, like, relative,  man ). In all seriousness, Einstein proved reality is not one fixed state. Reality  is really an infinite number of unique realities that depend on   where   you are,  and how fast you’re moving in spacetime. 71   More pragmatically, there are  70   For an example of this, one need only read academic textbooks on computational theo  ries of human memory.

133 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     three types of reality: (1)   objective reality , which are things like gravity that  we all experience, (2)   subjective reality , such as pain or another sensation  one might experience, and (3)   inter-subjective reality , which include shared  beliefs and sociological concepts (like money, politics, and power). 72  From a philosophical perspective, the concept of reality has been debated  for aeons. There are different ontological positions describing reality. These  positions include monism, dualism, pluralism, and my favorite—dialectical  monism. I’m not going to continue any further down the philosophical dis -  cussion of reality, but for now, think of reality as   any physical or metaphysical  truth you experience . By   physical truth , this refers to that which your sensory  system detects in your environment (sight, smell, taste, touch, sound).  By   metaphysical truth , this refers to that which your mind (or body—via  intuition) detects, experiences, and believes to be true. These sensations  and insights are your   reality , and they’re represented in   thought .  OK, whew! We’ve now successfully gone down the metaphysical and the -  oretical rabbit-hole. We’ve addressed what   thought   is, what   a memory   is,  what   human memory   is, and what   reality   is. Here’s a full summary of four  fundamental components involved in   knowledge development :     A   thought   is your mind’s representation of   reality .     A   memory   is a stored representation of a   thought .     Human memory   is the collective process of encoding, storing, and retriev  ing   a memory .     Reality   is any physical or metaphysical   truth   you experience.  Your Ultimate Task When Working with an Antinet  What we could technically do next is chase down the definition and our  understanding of   truth . Ultimately this exercise is never-ending. Like the  Antinet , the   truth   of the cosmos is a   self-referential ,   recursive   beast. It’s filled  with seemingly never-ending paradoxes that point back to its   self . 73   For an  72   Yuval Noah Harari,   Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow , Illustrated edition (New  York, NY: Harper, 2017), 144.  73   For advanced Antinetters: Here’s a sign that you’re on the right track when developing
134      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  example of what I mean by   self-referential , let’s take the dictionary’s definition  of   truth .   The Oxford English Dictionary   defines   truth   as “the quality or state  of being true.” 74   That’s as   self-referential   as it gets right there, and that’s the  truth   (I couldn’t help it). In brief, we can define truth simply as   that which  we believe as true . From there we can explore the concept of   belief , but I’m  going to stop now before someone gets hurt.  Ultimately, as   knowledge developers , and   knowledge creators , we’re all in the  business of   truth . When using an Antinet and writing down your   thoughts  in the form of notes, the ultimate goal is to write down   your truth —and  to do it   honestly . This directive is deathly serious. One of the most critical  factors that will make your time building an Antinet worthwhile is to write  down as honestly as possible, your   truth . For example, “The author men -  tions   rumination   and   surprise , but I fail to see the significance of such things.”  Or, “I honestly have no idea what my goal is with learning an Antinet at this  point, and the reason why is   x .” Or, “What the author says makes a lot of  sense; however, I’ve already invested so much time building thousands of  digital notes using tool   x . If I switch now, who’s to say I won’t just switch  again to a new knowledge tool three months from now!” 75  Writing your honest truth results in you taking your Antinet seriously.  It will mitigate the risk of ever abandoning it. Perhaps most importantly,  it will result in creating and publishing genius-level work built to inspire  others for centuries.  We humans have a very keen sense of bullshit. People are better than you  think at detecting bullshit. We can tell when someone’s writing the truth, and  knowledge using an Antinet: if you notice contradictions in your knowledge; if you  notice seemingly absurd paradoxes. If you notice one piece of insight, but can link to  the seemingly exact opposite insight (yet both ideas are true); All of these events are  a signal that you’re using the Antinet properly. They’re signals that you’re developing  knowledge properly. In fact, I have a section in my Antinet dedicated to such paradoxes  (“1609”). This is something you’ll want to create as well.  74   Stevenson and Lindberg, eds.,   New Oxford American Dictionary , s.v. “truth.”  75   The Antinet will be the very last knowledge development system you’ll ever need to  learn and use ( if   you stick to the knowledge development process I teach in Part III)!
135 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     when someone’s writing something just to sell books. The way to sell books  is, paradoxically, to   not try to sell books ! The way to sell books is to write the  truth—your truth. And that starts by writing the truth in the form of notes.  This doesn’t only apply to writing books, it applies to any form of creative  output (e.g. music, plays, songwriting, etc.). The bottom line is that, with the  Antinet, the name of the game is writing   your truth , as honestly as possible.  In Ernest Hemingway’s fantastic non-fiction book,   Death in the Afternoon ,  he takes the reader through the world of bullfighting. While it’s a seem -  ingly grotesque sport—especially in modern times—it is a book I highly  recommend reading if one wishes to observe what I mean by writing the  truth. It’s a master-course for what good writing is. In the book he writes  of bullfighting, “I should not try to defend it now, only to tell honestly the  things I have found true about it.” 76   Like Hemingway, your ultimate task  when developing your thoughts in the Antinet concerns itself with one  thing: it’s to tell honestly the things you find to be   true .  WHY AN ANTINET IS NOT ABOUT STORING NOTES  An Antinet is   not   an analog note database. It’s not even about storing notes.  The Antinet concerns itself with the dualistic emergence of a   second mind .  A second mind is formed by properly integrating the four principles of the  Antinet, and implementing an effective workflow enabling it to operate as  a   thinking system .  An Antinet is not a   notetaking system ; it’s not a notetaking app based on  the functionality of linking notes (that is,   wikilinks) . To its creator (Niklas  Luhmann), the Antinet was not “just an analog database,” writes Johannes  Schmidt. 77   It was not a container for storing notes; it was not chaotic for its  creator either. The Antinet “was not a maze but a thinking tool, a commu -  nication partner, and a publication machine.” 78  76   Ernest Hemingway,   Death in the Afternoon   (London: Vintage Books, 2000).  77   Johannes   Schmidt,   “Niklas   Luhmann’s   Card   Index:   Thinking   Tool,   Communication   Partner,  Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

136      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The problem with thinking of the Antinet as a   notetaking system   is that, well,  it’s   not   a notetaking system! The term   notetaking   connotes the idea that you’re  writing down facts or thoughts that are already formed. Luhmann’s Antinet  was not a notetaking system. Hell, even the principles of an Antinet are not  that important if the only thing they yield is the better   taking   of notes. The  reason why an Antinet is important centers on the benefits it yields for one’s  mind and thoughts. The Antinet is a   thinking system   because it transforms  the way one thinks. It also is a   thought system   because it develops thought,  both in the short term and the long term.  The key differentiator between an Antinet and a digital notetaking app is  precisely that the Antinet is a   thinking system .  The Antinet, when used properly, and when its four principles are involved,  results in one’s   thinking   being transformed. The way you read books and recall  thoughts changes in the course of using the Antinet. It’s an incommunicable  experience, and something I’ll be touching on throughout the book.  Digital notetaking apps, on the other hand, can perhaps be employed to  develop thought. In that respect they can be thought of as   thought systems ;  however, they cannot be characterized as a   thinking system   (unless they are  properly structured by way of the four principles of the Antinet). Even then,  a digital notetaking app’s effectiveness is watered down because it naturally  omits the first principle of the Antinet ( analog ).  The analog principle is critical because it involves writing by hand. This practice  results in neuroimprinting thoughts on the mind, which is a critical element  involved in a process called   neuro-associative recall , which we’ll discuss next.  From using the Antinet, it could be postulated that Luhmann’s mind  grew in two areas: (1) memory span of thought (or   thought-span ), and (2)  neuro-associative recall .  Let’s explore both of these concepts now.  in Early Modern Europe 53 (2016), https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/record/2942475, 311.
137 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     The Antinet’s Effect on the “Memory Span” of  Thoughts (“Thought-Span”)  Within the field of memory research, scientists use the term   memory span  to refer to the minimum number of items one can recall.  Related experiments traditionally focus on more rudimentary recall tasks.  They entail asking participants to recall a list of words, letters, or digits. 79   The  goal with an Antinet is to develop your memory span not for words, letters,  or digits; but to develop your memory span for   thought . That is, the goal  is to develop the mind to instantly recall thoughts, and to recall as many  thoughts as possible. This is what is meant by   thought-span . 80  How is it possible to develop the memory span of thoughts? This is achieved  through   neuroimprinting   thoughts on your mind via something called   elabo -  rative rehearsal   in the field of human memory. Also involved is   maintenance  rehearsal . Both of these processes are procured by a feature innate to the  Antinet by way of its first principle ( analog ). Before moving on, let’s take a  moment to address what is meant by the term   neuroimprinting .  NEUROIMPRINTING IN THE ANTINET  Within the world of copywriting (which is the profession of writing com -  pelling advertisements), one of the greatest copywriters who ever lived is  Gary Halbert. 81   This self-proclaimed, “Prince of Print,” used a method called  neuroimprinting   by which he taught copywriters how to become the best in  their field. The simple practice is to write down, by hand, every single word  (word-for-word) of the best advertisements ever written.  By trade, I was a copywriter in my previous professional life. Today, I am  more generally, a writer. I was a good copywriter—scratch that—I was really  79   On a related note, the average memory span of most people is five words, six letters, and  seven digits. This is why phone numbers in the United States consist of seven digits.  80   Kahana,   Foundations of Human Memory , 271.  81   Sir Gary C. Halbert, “The Prince of Print”.

138      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  good. My experience as a copywriter provided me with the greatest gift one  could ask for: a lime green Lamborghini.  Just kidding! 82   Success as a copywriter has given me the gift of   time . It’s given  me time to concentrate on writing about things I become fascinated with.  For the past year, this fascination became an obsession with the powerful  physical thinking system used by Niklas Luhmann. I had been writing and  developing a notecard database from readings over the course of sixteen  years. It wasn’t until fifteen years into this that I discovered the secret magic  of Niklas Luhmann’s Antinet. My notebox has since been transformed and  transitioned into an Antinet. How to transition a legacy notebox isn’t some -  thing I’ll cover right now, just know that it is indeed possible.  Here’s the point: I’ve had a lot of success as a copywriter, which has gifted  me with the time of writing right now, to you. The secret to how I developed  such skills as a copywriter can be found inside my own Antinet. Inside of  it, I have over three hundred hand-written notecards of the best headlines  ever written in advertising. I have personally experienced the magic of   neu -  roimprinting . I won’t belabor this point.   Neuroimprinting   is a critical tool for  developing one’s skills, mind, and thoughts. I have not found this magic to  translate into the digital medium in a lossless way.  If you write out a great poem by keyboard, it will be imprinted on your screen.  If you write out a great poem by hand, it will be imprinted on your soul.  the deep roots of neuroimprinting  It can be argued that   neuroimprinting   is a biological term observed to occur  in infant birds, such as geese, ducks, and chickens. 83   However I believe the  concept to be less formal in nature (scientifically). Regardless, I hold the  concept of   neuroimprinting   to be true because of empirical evidence.  82   I’ve since sold the Lamborghini. It was fun for a while, but I’m happier with a more sim -  ple life. Plus, my other car is great. It’s a Tesla Model S Plaid. It’s wrapped in a beautiful  lime green. And, oh yeah, it’s faster than the Lambo. The Italians have a lot of catching  up to do!  83   Hiroko Ohki-Hamazaki, “ Neurobiology of imprinting ,”   Brain and Nerve = Shinkei  Kenkyu No Shinpo   64, no. 6 (June 2012): 657–64.
139 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     The concept of neuroimprinting has rich and deep roots in scholarship. The  scholar Francesco Sacchini (1570–1625) cites ancients who copied down  texts. He explains they did such a practice not in order to have copies of  them, but in order to better retain the knowledge. 84  Sacchini recounts a story of Demosthenes copying down Thucydides eight  times in order to understand the ideas more thoroughly. Sacchini also asserts  that Saint Jerome (342–420   ad ) wrote many volumes by hand, “not due to  the weakness of his library but out of desire to profit from the exercise.” 85  The New England preacher Richard Steele wrote in 1682: “The very writing  of any thing fixes it deeper in the mind.” 86  At Harvard College in the late seventeenth century, students were taught in  the following manner. They were given the assignment to write down text -  books bought in England, by hand. 87   It may sound like a lazy way of teaching;  however, there remains a serious argument for the power of teaching students  by making them write out knowledge by hand. We have moved away from  the practice in modern times, but it’s something that may warrant revisiting.  The Antinet’s Effect: Neuro-Associative Recall  By   neuroimprinting   thoughts on your mind, via writing by hand, you’re  primed to develop the most important muscle for recognizing and installing  important thoughts from the books you read. The “muscle” I’m referring  to is the   neuro-associative recall “muscle”   of your brain. The strength of your  neuro-associative recall muscle   is predicated on the   analog   principle of the  Antinet. It’s also predicated on the   index   principle of the Antinet. The   index  principle forces you to imprint a term onto your mind. That term then maps  to a specific   numeric-alpha address . Without these two principles, you lose  the ability to exercise and strengthen the   neuro-associative recall muscle .  In other words, when using an Antinet you’re training your memory by  84   Ann Blair,   Early Modern Attitudes toward the Delegation of Copying and Note-Taking , 277.  85   Blair,   Early Modern Attitudes , 277.  86   Ann Blair,   Early Modern Attitudes , 277.  87   Ann Blair,   Early Modern Attitudes , 278.
140      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  lengthening the memory span in which to recall a   thought . You’re doing so  by   neuroimprinting   a cue (in the form of a keyterm). This cue acts as a way  to immediately recall thoughts to your mind. This exercises your   neuro-as -  sociative recall muscle , which transforms your brain. While reading you’ll  suddenly spot an idea or a thought. Instead of thinking of this thought as  something new, you’ll immediately think of the keyterm it relates to in the  Antinet. This better allows you to classify the idea, associate the idea, and  then develop the current knowledge that you have of the thought. All of this,  again, is founded on the four key principles of the Antinet. It’s specifically  founded on two of those principles working together ( analog   and   index ).  If it’s not apparent by now, it should start to become more obvious why the  four principles are so critical for developing the type of system Luhmann  used. When you strip the system of such functionality (which is what digital  Zettelkasten do), you prevent such phenomena from happening.  When you use a physical thinking tool like the Antinet, you end up exercis -  ing your brain and its various “muscles,” and its various pathways. There’s  no easy-way out; no lazy search mechanism that enables you to avoid  thinking and associating ideas. It may seem outdated at first, but I assure  you, a system that requires you to think and exercise your mind beats the  latest and greatest digital app every time. Why? Because the best computer  you’ll ever have is the one already operating inside your skull. Using an  Antinet results in developing this organ; it could be argued that digital  tools work in the opposite direction—perhaps they even tend to degrade  your thinking.  The Antinet Is Not in the Same Category as  “Notetaking Apps”  Notetaking apps primarily concern themselves with storing information  that is   mostly   developed already. With an Antinet system you’re developing  thoughts primarily through the process of writing them down by hand.  It is a thinking system because it produces thoughts. It’s not the best tool  for storing already thought-about information; though that does indeed  have major benefits ( neuroimprinting   the great ideas and work of others on  your mind). Primarily, the Antinet is a tool for developing information into  knowledge—knowledge being your own thoughts.
141 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     The primary benefit of a digital notetaking app is its   storage capacity . People  seem to find comfort in digitally storing notes and syncing them across  devices. They prefer this, without realizing they are prioritizing   storage   over  the more crucial benefit:   developing and evolving thought . It is my belief  that a system that develops and evolves thought into   developed thought   is  preferable to a system that merely stores (and links)   undeveloped thought .  Paradoxically, it seems that digital notetaking apps ultimately do a worse  job of storing thoughts. Why? Because information is encountered less  frequently, and thus recalled less frequently by the user than the knowledge  stored in an Antinet. Why? Because digital information faces the perennial  issue of generating a black hole of too much information.  WHY AN ANTINET IS NOT A “MEMORY SYSTEM”  While an Antinet is a   thinking system ; it’s not only that type of system.  It comprises other systems: it is a   memory system , but not   only   a memory  system; it’s also a   sorting system , and a   search system.   Markus Krajewski has  observed that an Antinet is not just a “memory aid” for recalling thoughts. It’s  also, (1) a “sorting aid” (for sorting through thoughts), (2) a “search engine”  (by way of   index ), and (3) a “computer” (in German,   Rechenmaschine ), “in the  strict etymological sense of   rechnen   as ‘to organize’, ‘to guide’ and ‘to prepare’.” 88  Another way of phrasing it is that an Antinet acts as a pre-processing engine  allowing your thoughts to become   ruminated   on, fixed, corrected, recor -  rected, and matured. All of this happens before even writing the first word  of your book, paper, essay, dissertation, blog post, or anything else. The way  in which a thought forms and evolves is also different compared to how it  would otherwise evolve in digital notetaking apps.  A key reason the Antinet is not a memory system, but more of a thinking  system, centers on its proficiency in bringing to the surface parts of your  thinking that are, upon further rumination, potentially not entirely correct.  The Antinet, thanks to its structure and analog design, allows for   proactive  interference . It does this in a manner that is different—if not entirely impos -  88   Markus Krajewski,   Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice of a Counter-Measurement  against Forgetting   (Brill, 2016), 319.
142      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  sible–for digital tools to achieve. What is meant by   proactive interference   will  be covered next.  Human memory is complex, important, and still a mystery. 89   When Luh -  mann began building his Antinet, it was in reaction to his “poor memory.” 90  Yet he discovered the issue to be much more complex, in part because his  understanding of memory was incomplete. What he referred to as a “poor  memory” when he began building his Antinet in the 1950s related to   retro -  active interference , the interference caused by losing thoughts you’ve already  previously learned.  Another type of interference in human memory prevents one from thinking  clearly. It’s called   proactive interference . 91   You’ve probably heard the expres -  sion involving the notion of   being your own worst enemy . This expression is  founded on the idea that your own false-beliefs and cognitive fallacies can  end up harming you more than any other person could. This isn’t an imag -  inary notion; much of the time it perfectly describes reality.  Wherever you go in life, you carry something with you. You carry information,  facts, knowledge, and beliefs. These are stored in your mind. These things  rely on your   memory   for their encoding, storage, and retrieval. There’s a  problem, however: your memory may have filled in gaps or assumptions with  an oversimplified representation of reality to support the encoding, storage,  and retrieval of thought(s). These parts proceed to go unquestioned; they’re  never analyzed or consciously recognized by yourself. The core problem with  this is that these memory shortcuts, if you will, end up preventing you from  assimilating new, deeper, and more profound ways to think about things. In  brief, it is not the   inability to recall thoughts   that is the problem; rather it’s the  inability to   learn and evolve current thoughts   that becomes a problem. This is  what is meant by   proactive interference .  89   Kahana,   Foundations of Human Memory , ix.  90   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner,   Publication   Machine,”   Forgetting   Machines.

143 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     Why does   proactive interference   happen? It happens because thoughts remain  in a fixed state; not in a state where they can evolve—and just as important—  not where the trail of a thought’s evolution can be clearly viewed. This is  one of the benefits of   analog   notecards. When notecards combine with the  evolving branching and stemming   tree structure   component of the Antinet, it  is possible to observe knowledge growth. This prevents thoughts from being  subject to   proactive interference   by forcing the thinker to constantly review  and recall thoughts they stumble across—this happens more frequently in  an Antinet because users are forced to swing from card to card, guided by  the index, instead of simply searching the collection by keyword (like in  digital notetaking apps).  Thinking systems that mitigate   proactive interference   are a critical component  to improving the intelligence of one’s work. “Intelligence is traditionally  viewed as the ability to think and learn. Yet, in a turbulent world, there’s  another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink  and unlearn.” 92   A system that mitigates   proactive interference   is a system that  helps one   rethink and unlearn . This type of system is precisely what the  Antinet allows with its third principle, the   tree structure .  In summary, the Antinet is   not   a memory system, alone. Memory systems  imply helping solve for one type of   interference   in human memory (that is,  the interference that causes one to forget something). The Antinet solves for  both types of interference in thought development (including the interfer -  ence caused by thinking you know something that you don’t really know).  WORKING WITH AN ANTINET DEVELOPS YOUR  MEMORY FACULTIES  An Antinet is not an external system that enables you to simply offload the  energy you’d otherwise rely on for your brain to recall thoughts. It acts as  a system that exercises and enhances your brain’s memory faculties. That  is, the Antinet enhances your brain’s ability to encode, store, and recall  92   Adam Grant,   Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know   (New York, New  York: Viking, 2021), 2.
144      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  thought(s). The Antinet, with its neuroimprinting process, develops your  mind’s capabilities for   recollecting   and   recognizing   interesting patterns when  you read. This enables you to make connections to material   ruminating   in  your Antinet. In the field of human memory studies, this involves a process  called   recognition . 93   Let’s cover this briefly now.  In the field of human memory studies, when you   recognize   a concept, two  processes occur in the mind:  1.   Familiarity: this process involves placing a confidence value on how  familiar you are with the content you encounter. This includes what those  who study human memory call   strength theory .  2 . Recollection: this process involves the recall of   contextual   information  related to the content you encounter while reading.  It’s critical to   recognize   a concept while reading because it provides for two  things: (1) it enables you to create information via   comparison , and (2) it  allows you to relate this information to a   selective   set of other   relations . This  is a necessary precursor for creating knowledge, and ultimately, achieving  wisdom. The concept of   selective relations   will be discussed at length later  in this book.  Let’s jump back to the two processes occurring in the mind during   recogni -  tion:   familiarity   and   recollection . The question becomes   How does the Antinet  serve to enhance these two processes?  The Antinet enhances the process of   familiarity   (familiarity with a concept)  through the practice of two of its principles: (1) its   analog   principle, which  spawns   neuroimprinting , and (2) its   index   component, which results in consis -  tent reviewing of information while searching for previously-noted thoughts.  The Antinet also enhances the process of   recollection   through forcing users  to   develop thoughts within contexts . This emerges via the third principle of the  93   Kahana,   Foundations of Human Memory , 102.
145 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     Antinet, its   tree structure . Users create different   contexts   by organizing their  knowledge around   branches , or   stems of thought   in their Antinet.  As scholars have observed, both variables ( familiarity   and   recollection ) para -  doxically transform a notetaking system from something designed to replace  human memory into a system that both replaces   and   enhances human  memory. Alberto Cevolini points out that   handwritten notetaking, due to the  repetition that helps the mind retain passages, and the respective construction of  a card index, serve as both a substitute for personal memory and a memory aid . 94  The Antinet structures itself in a way that enhances the   familiarity   and  recollection   processes involved in   recognition . This allows you to   recognize  thoughts from readings, and better   encode   and   store   those thoughts for later  recall . In short, the Antinet achieves this from doing one thing: developing  your mind and its memory.  AN ANTINET IS PRIMARILY A THINKING SYSTEM  By now it should be apparent that an Antinet is not a notetaking app cen -  tered on the convenient storage of and access to thoughts. Its primary  concern is in the developing and evolving of   thought . An   Antinet   is not  a notetaking system. What an Antinet really is, is quite apparent: it’s a  thinking system . If you want a   memory system , there are tools like   Anki. 95   If  you want a notetaking system, perhaps one of the digital notetaking apps  (or supposed digital Zettelkasten) would be of value. The Antinet, on the  other hand, is a   thinking system . It’s a   thought development system , as well. It  falls under the all-encompassing concept of a   knowledge development system .  It naturally improves your memory, but it does more: (1) it strengthens your  neuro-associative recall ability , which was touched upon previously, and (2)  the Antinet improves your ability to   learn   faster, and at a deeper level.  Specifically, in human memory, there are several critical processes we’ve  discussed already: (1)   recognition , (2)   recall , and (3)   familiarity . However,  94   Cevolini, ed.,   Forgetting Machines , 24.  95   “Anki—Powerful, Intelligent Flashcards,” accessed January 14, 2022, https://apps.anki -  web.net/.
146      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  there’s another process that is just as critical. That process is known as   asso -  ciation . 96   This concept will be further explored later in the book.  In brief, a traditional notetaking system is more like a   personal information  storage system . Again, an Antinet is a   thinking system . It’s also a   thought devel -  opment system . It’s something that develops thought in both the   short term  and the   long term   because of what memory is. Sure, human memory’s raw  material consists of memories, which are representations of thought; how -  ever, the process of memory itself is an   active   process, an “active operation.” 97  Now that you know what an Antinet   primarily   is, you’re starting to get a  clearer idea of what an Antinet   really   is, which we’ll be diving into next.  Be forewarned, however, that we’re about to get   metaphysical . Don’t worry,  it’s not spiritual woo-woo stuff. There will be no tarot cards read, or astro -  logical birth-charts to explain what an Antinet really is. However, we are  getting more and more into the land of empirical productivity. And this  land, as Luhmann himself expressed, is filled with incommunicable truth.  Let’s proceed into this land now.  INTRODUCING YOUR SECOND MIND  The magic inherent in the system Niklas Luhmann built did not center on  its features. Many think the key defining magic in Luhmann’s system is its  ability to link notes (that is, to create so-called   wikilinks ). Or, thanks to some  authors, some are led to believe the magic centers on Luhmann’s proclivity  to elaborate on notes, as opposed to collecting excerpts from books. 98   Both  of these notions do not encapsulate the magic of Luhmann’s system.  96   Kahana,   Foundations of Human Memory , 112.  97   Markus Krajewski,   Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice of a Counter-Measurement  against Forgetting   (Brill, 2016).  98   Such as Sönke Ahrens and his book,   How to Take Smart Notes ; also, the notion that  Luhmann did not excerpt passages from books is false. Luhmann most definitely did  quote texts in both of his Zettelkasten.
147 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     The Two “Magical” Effects That Emerge  from an Antinet  The magic of Luhmann’s system stems from two effects that emerge   when  the four principles of the Antinet are implemented properly.  The first magical effect is what happened to Luhmann’s mind (and by extrap -  olation, what can happen to yours). Luhmann’s mind essentially morphed  from using the Antinet. This metamorphosis of Luhmann’s brain, I contend,  would not have taken place if he used digital tools (which lack the four  principles of the Antinet).  We’ve already discussed the ways in which the mind changes from using an  Antinet. This includes the impact of   neuroimprinting , and how one’s reading  changes due to the exercising of one’s   neuro-associative recall   muscle. For this  reason I won’t go into detail on such now.  The second magical effect is what happened after a “number of years” work -  ing with his Antinet. Until the emergence of the second magical effect, the  Antinet “functions as a mere container from which we can retrieve what we  put in,” writes Luhmann. 99   After Luhmann outlines the four principles of  the Antinet in his paper, Luhmann explains that something else emerges:  “an alter ego with who we can constantly communicate.” 100   In other words,  it is a   second mind . Luhmann writes that such an entity emerges “as a result  of extensive work with this technique.” 101  HOW DOES THIS SECOND MIND EMERGE?  The   second mind   emerges thanks to (1) long-term thought evolution, as well  as (2) short-term thought development, which happen on paper via writing  by hand. These aspects of the Antinet effectively transform it from a   mere  container   of notes, into a different metaphysical entity altogether. Similar to  the human phenomenon of   consciousness , and related to the   whole-part theory  99 “Communicating with Slip Boxes by Niklas Luhmann,” accessed May 4, 2021, https://  luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes.  100   Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes.”  101   Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes.”
148      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  and   mind-body duality , the Antinet proceeds through a similar metamor -  phosis. The nature of this   mind-body duality   is what we’ll venture into next.  The Mind-Body Duality of the Antinet  One of the most intriguing fields in philosophy studies the   mind-body problem .  The philosophical branch called   philosophy of mind   studies this phenome -  non. In brief, it all centers on these questions:   What is the mind?   What is  consciousness?   Does the mind even exist?   Are your thoughts formed by your brain,  which is a whole system made up of individual parts (for example, neurons)?  If one subscribes to a   materialist   view of the world, then there is no mind. There’s  only your brain, with its neurons that connect to other neurons. We’re just one  big blob of biochemical processes, according to some pop-science authors. 102  In other words, the interaction of neurons connecting to other neurons,  is the illusion we call the mind. But is this all there is? Or is there a whole  created by these neurons that is greater than the sum of its parts? This sum -  marizes the mind-body debate which has stumped the greatest thinkers for  hundreds of years.  As an aside, according to Hans-Georg Moeller, who studies Luhmann’s  theoretical work, Niklas Luhmann apparently introduced a solution to this  problem, deeming it “the most obvious, and yet most overlooked achieve -  ment of the Luhmannian shift to theory.” 103   But I won’t take you down that  rabbit-hole right now. I’m interested in helping you create genius-level work  that shakes up the field you’re in for two hundred years. The system which  will help you do this is the Antinet, so I’ll focus on that.  In summary, only you can decide whether or not you have a mind. Your  experience of the mind is just that—an experience. It’s empirical, but you’re  102   For instance, in   Homo Deus , Yuval Noah Harari claims the mind does not exist. Such  an entity has never been identified.

Luhmann grants that the usual research methods of empirical sociology  would fail; yet, “still, it is empirical, as this case really obtains.” 104  THE BRAIN OF THE ANTINET  The one prerequisite for creating a second mind, and even forming and  devising the mind-body problem is one thing: it’s called…a brain!  Think of the brain of your Antinet as the raw material, the notecards, and  the four principles applied within the notebox. The brain of the Antinet is  composed of analog notecards, numeric-alpha addresses, the tree structure,  the index, and the network. The brain one creates using this structure is  unique, and thus will create a unique second mind. The second mind that  emerges from a different brain will by nature be quite different. For instance,  a compilation of notecards organized by author or category is much more  conventional than an Antinet. The Antinet is a structure of both order and  disorder. This is why it is so critical to pay attention to how Luhmann built  his Antinet. It is why it’s critical to not abstract away its parts into whatever  you deem more convenient or modern. Luhmann structured the brain of his  Antinet with an intimate understanding of how human memory works. Only  by building a system composed of the same parts of the human brain can one  effectively create one of the magical effects of the Antinet—a second mind.  Does the idea of creating a metaphysical entity (a   second mind ) out of a box  of notecards sound questionable? If so, that’s fine! Again, Luhmann pref -  aced his paper with the assertion that this whole subject area is empirical.  In other words, you can’t spend your time just reading about it, or asking  questions in Zettelkasten forums online. There’s only one way you can  decide whether or not there’s any   truth   in the concept of a   second mind , and  that is to test it out yourself.  104   Luhmann,   “Communicating with Slip Boxes.” Luhmann writes, “What follows is a  piece of empirical sociology. It concerns me and someone else, namely my slip box   or  index card file . It should be clear that the usual methods of empirical sociology would  fail in this special case. Still, it is empirical, as this case really obtains.”
150      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Later in the book I’ll be taking you through, in detail, precisely how you  go about testing out the Antinet yourself. Until then, let’s dive into more  detail and research on the concept of the   second mind , or, what Luhmann  once referred to it as, the   ghost in the box .  The Ghost in the Antinet  When you peruse the thoughts written in the hand of someone who has  died, it’s almost as if there’s a ghost-like quality to it. Ann Blair observes that  handwriting gives readers a “privileged point of access to the person writing.” 105  This phenomenon is experienced with the Antinet. Yet unlike Blair’s exam -  ple, when it’s just you and your Antinet, you experience this sensation by  reading your own thoughts, written in your own hand. When working with  an Antinet, you begin communicating with yourself in a unique fashion.  Instead of an   internal monologue , you begin to experience something called  internal dialogue . More on this will be discussed later.  John Locke realized the advantages of having an   internal dialogue . He expe -  rienced the advantages of viewing a historical record of his own thinking.  It “carried the possibility of him reading it, in the future, as a historical record  of his thinking.” 106   It allowed him to have a dialogue with himself, and to see  where his thinking went wrong.  Reading Johannes Schmidt’s account of perusing the contents of Luh -  mann’s Antinet, one pictures Schmidt having a similar experience. It’s an  experience of perusing the “backstage” and inner thoughts of one’s own  mind. Of Luhmann’s Antinet, Schmidt observes that it “is more than just an  analog database of Luhmann’s theory.” Schmidt likens it to “the backstage”  of Luhmann’s grand theory and scholarly work, “and therefore [as] Niklas  Luhmann’s intellectual autobiography.” 107  105   Blair,   Early Modern Attitudes , 265.  106   Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory , 149.  107   Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool,” 310.
151 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     Of the   mind in a box   or   ghost in the box   concept, Niklas Luhmann himself put  forth an interesting illustration. Recognizing that this concept is difficult to  communicate, Luhmann chose to illustrate this by comparing reading notes  without access to the second mind, with the difference between viewing  porn and having sex.  In one of the infamous notecards in the Zettelkasten section he used for  preparing the paper   Communication with Noteboxes , Luhmann wrote:  Ghost in the box?  Spectators come. You get to see everything and nothing but  that—like porn movies. And so is the disappointment. 108  What Luhmann means is that the voyeur sees everything, just as people get  to see all of Luhmann’s thoughts when perusing his Antinet. However, in  reality, they’re seeing   nothing . They’re not seeing the internal dialogue and  experience Luhmann himself has when he (as its creator) peruses his own  Antinet. Like watching porn, you get to see everything; yet, you don’t expe -  rience the incommunicable connection and internal/communal dialogue  two lovers are having during sex. Granted, perhaps the internal dialogue  isn’t as prevalent when two porn stars are going at it, but you get the point.  Modern day scientists agree with Luhmann’s notion of a   mind in a box  emerging from Antinets (and other physical external memory devices).  “The effectiveness of [Antinets] does not lie in the sporadic access that it  provides to single entries, or in what these entries, once selected, may teach  the user. A card index is a true secondary memory when…inquiries become  an opportunity to trigger a network of associative references and links  which give birth to ‘collaborative’ reasoning that had not been previously  designed.” 109   The scholar, Alberto Cevolini, confirms this notion. “To argue  that the filing cabinet simply stores records would be to give a too short (and  108   “ZK II: Note 9 / 8.3—Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed January 11, 2022,   https://  niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8-3_V .  109   Cevolini, ed.,   Forgetting Machines , 19–20.
152      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  therefore misleading) description of the interplay of user and machine.” 110  The   interplay of user and machine   provides an external glimpse into what’s  really going on—internal dialogue with yourself, and an instantiation of  yourself in external form (your second mind).  The concept of this   second mind , and the internal dialogue which emerges  as a result of its presence, has been observed and studied by scholars as the  interaction between the following items: (1)   external memory   (that is, the  Antinet), and (2)   internal memory   (the memory biologically stored inside  your brain and body).  After studying John Boyle, John Locke, and Robert Hooke, Alberto Cevolini  confirms “that annotations that are stored in the external memory can func -  tion only in tandem with internal memory, so excerpts and notes prompt  recollection of more than what they actually contain.” 111  In other words, the notes in your Antinet set off a chain-reaction of  thought-connections; that is, the notes in your Antinet act as a cue that  precipitates a chain-reaction of communication and internal dialogue.  This generates the   recall   process in your mind.  In their paper   The Extended Mind , Andy Clark and David J. Chalmers, assert  that the memories contained in external form (like the Antinet) are not  merely memory systems, and therefore, they’re not really external memo -  ries. 112   Rather, they’re   extended minds .  THE TERM “SECOND MIND”  In the field of knowledge, a term that is increasingly popular is   extended mind .  The scholar, Richard Yeo, argues that the term   extended mind   is problematic  because confusion arises between   consciousness   and   communication . “Con -  sequently, memory is seen as a psychic phenomenon.” Yeo further points  110   Cevolini, ed.,   Forgetting Machines , 19.  111   Cevolini, ed.,   Forgetting Machines , 12.  112   Andy Clark and David J.

And by   mind , he asks whether it should be termed   cognition , which  refers to the mental action of acquiring knowledge and understanding. 113  The problem with the term   extended cognition   centers on the fact that it  misses the   ghost in the box   quality or phenomenon Luhmann, and other  scholars have described. However, there may be some validity to the issue  Yeo points out concerning the term   extended . For this reason, I choose to  retain the term   mind   (in order to encapsulate the ghost-like spirit and the  experience of having internal dialogue). However, I opt to drop   extended ,  and prefer   second   in its place. Why? Because as Yeo points out,   extended   is a  rather vague term.   Is it truly extended thought since it ’ s really my own thought ?  Or is it rather a second storage mechanism for my own thought ? As a result,  I opt for   second .  Finally, we get to the point of what an Antinet really is: a   second mind .  SECOND MIND VS. SECOND BRAIN  You may be wondering about the recent popularity of the term   second brain  used by Tiago Forte.  Forte runs a business which sells online courses that aim to “train knowledge  workers in how to use technology to radically improve their productivity.” 114  Forte’s material centers on upgrading David Allen’s   Getting Things Done  method . He teaches people how to capture material they read online, and  how to process that material to get things done. He proposes the concept  of organizing content into explicit areas like   projects   and   resources .  As far as knowledge development goes, Forte doesn’t have too much to say.  I believe this to be the case because, “[Forte’s course] Building A Second Brain  started out as a course on using Evernote more effectively.” 115   Evernote is  113   Cevolini, ed.,   Forgetting Machines , 12.  114   “About   Forte   Labs,”   Forte   Labs,   accessed   January   17,   2022,   https://fortelabs.co/about-forte-labs/.  115   “Building A Second Brain,” Fernando Gros, June 24, 2020, https:// fernandogros. com/  building-a-second-brain/.

Rather it focuses on cross-device digital storage  of   information .  In brief, Forte’s usage of the term,   second brain   really relates to processes  inspired by David Allen’s   Getting Things Done   (“GTD”). Forte’s primary  application of the term   second brain   revolves around productivity (not  knowledge development). And this is fine! I have nothing against this, even  though I don’t subscribe to it.  Forte moves David Allen’s   Getting Things Done   into the digital age. He does  this by proposing strategies for organizing digital information into seemingly  logical categories on your computer (for instance a folder for   projects ). This  really isn’t a   brain ; it’s more of a philosophy on being more productive with  digital information.  Regardless of Forte’s   second brain   not really being a   second brain   (but more  a digital productivity philosophy), I hold that a   second brain   isn’t really what  you want anyway (if your goal is knowledge creation).  you want a second mind, not a second brain  With Forte teaching how to record information (using apps like Evernote),  he’s essentially promoting a system that cannot communicate with itself.  Evernote is not a system that contains parts that can self-reference in a fixed,  permanent state. It’s essentially a brain comprised of a blob of neurons—  a blob of neurons that cannot communicate with one another and that cannot  connect with one another to create new entities. Many digital Zettelkasten  are second brains; however, they’re not   second minds . Digital Zettelkasten  are a hodge-podge of parts that don’t communicate. Instead of a tree of  knowledge, they’re a pile of leaves. If a person’s brain were constructed  in the same manner, the person would not be alive. They’d be a vegetable.  In brief, you want a   second mind , not a   second brain . A brain is a materialistic  blob of biochemical gunk. A   second mind   is a system wherein the whole has  become greater than the sum of its parts. While I could continue down this  metaphorical road, I won’t belabor this too much.
155 W HAT   I S   AN   A NTINET ?     One last thing, before we move on: I believe Tiago Forte’s content is helpful  and valuable for those who wish to be more productive working with digital  information. If that’s what you’re looking for, this book is not for you. We’re  concerned with knowledge development. We’re concerned with developing  and evolving your thoughts (both in the short term and long term). The  reason we’re concerned with such centers around one thing: creating genius-  level knowledge.   The goal with the Antinet is to turn you into a learning  machine, a content machine, a research machine, and a writing machine.  Bottom line: if you do what I outline in this book, you’ll become all of  these things. You’ll become   an unstoppable knowledge machine .  the problem in trying to explain a second mind  Niklas Luhmann was one of the major thinkers involved in the establish -  ment of   systems theory , especially within the sociological sphere. 116   It is  therefore rather intriguing that he did not use   systems theory   as the basis  for his explanation of the Antinet; rather, he used   communication theory   to  explain it. One problem with Luhmann using communication theory, how -  ever, is that a core part of human experience and knowledge is more than  that which is acquired through theory. Rather, truth and reality, at least for  humanity, are also influenced by the metaphysical realm. Both Eastern and  Western philosophies share one common assumption: that there is such a  thing as   incommunicable truth . 117   This concept suggests that in order to truly  understand the power of the second mind, it cannot be taught; rather, it  can only be experienced.  Another issue with trying to explain an Antinet is the fact that it could take  a number of years of working with it before the   second mind   emerges. This is  116   Rudolf Stichweh,   Systems Theory ; “Since its beginnings the social sciences were an  important part of the establishment of systems theory. Jürgen Ruesch and Gregory  Bateson were in 1951 the first who tried to base a social science discipline on an infor -  mation and communication theory coming from cybernetics (“Communication. The  Social Matrix of Psychiatry”). But the two most influential suggestions were the com -  prehensive sociological versions of systems theory which were proposed by Talcott  Parsons since the 1950s and by Niklas Luhmann since the 1970s.”  117   Joseph Campbell, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, 3rd ed, Bollingen Series XVII  (Novato, Calif: New World Library, 2008), 25.
156      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  one factor all too conveniently omitted from books like   How to Take Smart  Notes . Again, for better or worse, Luhmann declares in his paper that it will  be a number of years before the   second mind   emerges; until then the Antinet  operates as a mere container for storing notes.  In my experience, however, the emergence of the   second mind   comes sooner  than several years into the practice. It is likely to emerge several months  after regular and committed use. For me, it emerged perhaps three or four  months after I began working with it. However, it should be noted that I  worked with it five days a week. In addition, the presence of the second  mind grows stronger every single day.  The bottom line is this: the more time you spend with a thing, the more of  you it becomes, and, the more of it becomes of you.  The Nature of the Second Mind  The Antinet is a unique type of system; more so than the novelties preached  in digital-Zettelkasten-land which over-emphasize its features, yet overlook  the magic. 118   An Antinet is an   intrapersonal knowledge system . It possesses a  unique proclivity for inducing internal dialogue (as opposed to internal  monologue). Its evolution over time happens in a self-organized fashion  that cannot be pre-planned. It’s also consciousness-oriented, instead of  comprehension-oriented. It works in tandem with its creator and is not  designed to be a stand-alone system that is easily comprehensible to the  public eye. The material and content it contains stem from deep-thinking,  from working out ideas on paper, through rumination, and in the seeking  of deep understanding. The ideas that emerge from it will surprise you.  What makes it even more surprising is seeing how the ideas stem from  you—from your own handwriting. The nature of the Antinet is founded  on a   communication theory   because   it really is   a communication relationship  between you, and your past self. When you try and transition such a system  to digital, you’re destroying a core aspect of the Antinet. You’re destroying  118   These include features like linking notes, atomic notes, and other flavor-of-the-month  ideas.

When I read my handwritten notes, and observe the material of the note -  cards it was written on from fifteen years ago, it communicates something to  me—something special that cannot be communicated in digital-file format.  I see myself in my handwriting . I see the state of my life I was in at the time.  I see the state of my mind at the time. Sometimes I have a reverence and  respect for what I’ve written.   Did I really write that and come up with that?  And sometimes I see something where I think,   Geez, I’ve really developed  my thinking, and my mind, and have grown a lot since then . This is one aspect  and one experience you’ll have when working with your   second mind . I’m  excited for you to experience it, but that’s really all I’m going to say for now.  I’ll share more in detail later in the book; however, as I’ve mentioned before,  much of it is   incommunicable .  The reason one ought to take the four principles Luhmann outlined so seri -  ously is that they’re key ingredients for transforming an Antinet into what  it   really   is, which is a   second mind .  I’ve touched on the importance of the four principles already; however, it’s  worth restating how intentional Luhmann was in the construction of the  Antinet. One scholar observed Luhmann’s system is “clearly constructed as  a cybernetic machine.” 119   Luhmann was influenced by cybernetics, the field  concerned with the study of goal-oriented systems founded on   communication  and   feedback . Ultimately, Luhmann’s Antinet “reproduces itself recursively”  in order to produce knowledge. 120  The Antinet also relates to another concept Luhmann introduced to the  field of sociology— autopoiesis . 121   This term stems from two Greek terms (1)  αὐτo- ( auto ), which translates to   self , and (2) ποίησις ( poiesis ), which means  119   Cevolini, ed.,   Forgetting Machines , 26.  120   Cevolini, ed.,   Forgetting Machines , 26.  121   “Autopoiesis—an Overview | ScienceDirect Topics,” accessed January 18, 2022, https://  www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/autopoiesis.

While it could be argued the Antinet exhibits   autopoiesis , it technically  doesn’t create other Antinets; rather, it creates a different entity altogeth -  er—a metaphysical   second mind   with whom you communicate. While the  Antinet itself may not be autopoietic, the second mind that emerges from  the system, and specifically its memory, could be said to “function as an  autopoietic system,” observes the scholar, Alberto Cevolini. 122  CONCLUSION  By now, you’re starting to understand the depth of this seemingly-simple  system of notecards. Before moving forward let’s recap what we’ve covered.  As you may recall, we defined an   Antinet   as a system comprising four prin -  ciples which form a   thinking system . This   thinking system   transforms itself  into a   second mind .  You know what the four principles of the Antinet are ( analog ,   numeric-  alpha ,   tree ,   index ). You understand the Antinet is a   network . You know what  is meant by the Antinet as a   thinking system . You are also familiar with the  concept of the   second mind .  What we’re going to cover next concerns the scientific reasoning for devoting  so much energy and commitment to such a system. We’re going to explore  this by taking a closer look at the explicitness in Luhmann’s design of the  Antinet. We’ll be doing this by diving into each of the principles of Luhmann’s  Antinet individually. We’ll be starting where the magic of the Antinet really  begins: its analog nature.

159  C H A PT E R S I X  �  ANALOG  “ The technical requirements   of   slip boxes involve wooden boxes, which have drawers  that can be pulled open, and pieces of paper in octavo format (about half of a  letter-size sheet [4 x 6 inch notecards or   a 6 paper slips]). We should only write  on one side of these papers so that in searching through them, we do not have  to take out a paper in order to read it. This doubles the space, but not entirely  (since we would not write on both sides of all the slips). This consideration is not  unimportant as the arrangement of boxes can, after some decades, become so  large that it cannot be easily be used from one’s chair. In order to counteract this  tendency, I recommend taking normal paper and not card stock. ”  —Niklas Luhmann,   Communication with Noteboxes 1  DISCOVERING THE ANALOG  IMPLEMENTATION OF ZETTELKASTEN  I stumbled upon the analog   version of the Zettelkasten purely by acci -  dent. At the time, I was fully committed to the digital version. I actually  came upon the idea of the analog Zettelkasten through Sönke Ahrens’s book  How to Take Smart Notes . It was a brief mention, but it was enough to get  me started on the path. A path that would become my life for the following  year: reverse-engineering how the analog Zettelkasten   actually   worked.  1   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans. Manfred  Kuehn, https://daily.scottscheper.com/zettelkasten/.
160      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Initially I tried using the analog version of the Zettelkasten merely to implement  anything I was not currently doing using the digital notetaking app, Obsidian.  I hoped that Ahrens’s book could help me mitigate my fear of stopping the  current streak I was on (of creating and publishing content consistently).  I had some good momentum, which finally seemed to have pulled me out  of a lull of just   consuming   knowledge (instead of producing it).  I was on day forty-eight of my commitment to my daily practice (which  entailed things like reading every morning, installing the right mental mind -  set, working out, actually getting out of my house, and going to my office).  It was a Sunday in early March at 2:16 pm. Before getting down to work in  my office in downtown San Diego, I wrote the following:  One thing I will say is this: I had the thought today that I really wish and  hope that I [do] not make [my daily writing practice] a chore by going insane  [using] an atomic workflow.  Atomic workflow   is a term that refers to a trend in web development. The aim  is to simplify components of websites by creating representations of different  website parts analogous to biological concepts (atoms, molecules, organisms,  etc.). For instance, a button on a website is likened to an atom. An input field is  another atom. When both atoms are combined, they create a search box (which  is likened to a molecule). The search molecule provides search functionality. 2  Novel, though this idea may appear, it adds yet another layer of abstraction  (and distraction) to the already overly complex field of web development.  The temptation to apply the concept of   atomicity   to fields is not new. In fact,  in the field of human memory studies, one researcher proposed that human  memory, too, adheres to the atomic composition principle. In other words,  2   “Atomic Design Methodology | Atomic Design by Brad Frost,” accessed July 15, 2021,  http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/.
161 A NALOG     an item in memory is not one single thing; rather, it’s composed of many  smaller subunits like protons, neutrons, and electrons.  The problem with this is the fact that atomicity can be loosely applied to  almost anything. This sentence is atomic. Each sentence is an organelle,  comprising molecules (words) that themselves comprise atoms (individual  letters). This whole abstraction really doesn’t do much. It’s just a trendy fad  to break things apart into   atomic   components. It distracts from the really  important stuff, that is, your actual writing output.  The atomic design ideology seems to have gripped the imaginations of those  enthralled with the world of personal knowledge management (“PKM”).  The PKM folk end up spending much of their time on forums debating  workflows and best practices which, paradoxically, results in less productivity.  As a result, less knowledge is developed for PKM folk to “manage.”  Back to the story: on that Sunday afternoon in my office, I felt myself falling  into the trap of   majoring in the minor . I’ve fallen into this trap thousands of  times. I was worried and fearful that all of my recent hard work and progress  in getting out of my creative lull and into a productive lifestyle was at risk.  The reason why comes down to one word:   complexity . The whole   atomic  workflow   concept became a distraction. It led me into the land PKM people  habitually become infatuated with: templates, workflows, layouts, plugins,  CSS styles, etc.  Yet, I held out   hope   that the solution to not falling into the trap of complexity  would be resolved by reading Sönke Ahrens’s book on notetaking.  When I started reading   How to Take Smart Notes   I got a glimpse of how to  actually build out an analog Zettelkasten. Every other place online, including  the most visited website promoting Zettelkasten, only taught the digital  version of the system.  I remember the realization and thoughts I had shortly after trying out the  analog form of the Zettelkasten. I said to myself,   Ohhh, so this is what the  Zettelkasten is actually supposed to be like ! Mind you, this was after I had spent
162      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  months learning what a Zettelkasten   supposedly   was (according to people  who taught the digital Zettelkasten).  At this point I had already gone through a six-week-long course on linking  digital notes, and a ninety minute one-on-one session with the creator of  the course. Yet, the lightbulb didn’t turn on until I actually tried using a  Zettelkasten in analog form. Side note: It makes me wonder if the people  teaching digital notetaking courses are even aware of what working with a  Zettelkasten is   actually   supposed to feel like!  Anyway, at the time I thought I knew what a Zettelkasten was, but after trying  an analog Zettelkasten, it became clear to me that I didn’t. At most I knew  10% of what a Zettelkasten really was all about. I didn’t realize how little I  knew about the system until much later. It also took me a while after that  to discover that Ahrens’s interpretation of Luhmann’s system was actually  quite different from what Luhmann actually did.  It was very soon into my working with the analog Zettelkasten that I  realized how much better the physical version was. I thought it took me  about a week to realize this; however, after reviewing my notes later on,  I realized it was even sooner than a week that I realized the power of  analog. I felt a sense that analog was more powerful than digital not by a  little bit, but by a lot!  It was important that the benefits of analog needed to outweigh the benefits  of digital by a large margin because I had spent many months of my life  building out an extensive digital Zettelkasten (with over a thousand notes).  However, even with the extensive amount of work I put into the digital  Zettelkasten system, I simply couldn’t deny the truth: the analog version  of the Zettelkasten was simply better than the digital.  Two days after I had started reading   How to Take Smart Notes , I wrote the  following down in my journal: “I can’t help but feel like it may be best to  move towards analog completely.” I then added the following admission:  “To be honest, the primary thing that makes me want to stick with my
163 A NALOG     digital notetaking app is the beautiful font and layout and style I spent this  weekend creating.”  The truth was apparent: the digital Zettelkasten system resulted in me   not  producing genius-level creative output. Instead the digital Zettelkasten  system resulted in me distracting myself with the bells and whistles of the  tool. The most recent time-sucks had included restructuring the directory  structure and folders of my notes into an atomic format. It also included me  spending an entire weekend creating a nifty theme for my notes. I sometimes  just can’t help but get distracted with things that don’t matter!  Anyway, I found myself still resistant to switching over completely to analog  because of the   sunk cost fallacy . I was committed to digital because of how  much time I had already spent building out my digital notes. Plus, I had no  idea about the power of analog yet. As one Antinetter put it to me, “When  you use digital notetaking apps, you have no idea how lost you are   until   you  switch to analog.”  Anyway, to help me through this process, I did the ole Benjamin Franklin  tactic. I created a pros and cons list.  Here’s what I wrote down in my journal:  Pros of Analog:     Simple     Fewer distractions     Makes use of my beautiful Montblanc pens     More freedom and creativity     Past success (writing by hand really helped  my results in college)     Academic research backing improved   understanding  while learning by writing by hand     Constraints breed creativity     Feynman said “thinking is writing,” and by this he meant,  writing longhand.
164      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Cons of Analog:     Cannot quickly search for keywords. Though to be fair, I don’t even use  this feature too extensively right now with [my digital notetaking app].  In addition, the results are rarely   that   relevant to what I’m looking for).     Misses out on training me to write quickly and freely on the keyboard.  Though, to be fair, is this really a con? It may be good to slow down and  write via longhand because it forces me to actually   think   deeply before  I write.     Cannot share or publish my notes easily online. Though, who even wants  half-developed information? It’s best to publish work that has already  been   deeply   processed and structured.  These were my initial pros and cons, and they are largely still true today;  however, I’ve learned more since writing that list. There are more cons to  consider, of course (like the risk of fire or water damage to notes, which I’ll  address). Yet I discovered later that the initial cons of analog actually are  some of its greatest pros.  Let’s now dive into a more in-depth look at the pros and cons of analog I’ve  since realized.  THE PROS OF ANALOG  ANALOG CREATES A BETTER COMMUNICATION  PARTNER THAN DIGITAL  A thing people seem to overlook in regards to Luhmann’s Zettelkasten is  that, to Luhmann, his Zettelkasten was not a tool. It was a person.  Animism   centers on the belief that certain objects, places, plants, and crea -  tures possess a distinct spiritual essence—a soul, if you will. The Antinet  serves as a perfect example for such an idea. The Antinet becomes its own  unique entity with its own unique personality with whom you communicate.  This type of system is watered-down in the world of digital notetaking apps.  Digital notetaking apps rarely retain a core structure. Their arms, legs, and  feet (i.e., notes, directories, and tags) can be deleted on a whim. They have
165 A NALOG     nothing to build on or stand on. Digital Zettelkasten systems end up looking  like a massive interlinked graph of notes, with no personality.  The Antinet, on the other hand, does indeed retain a core structure. Its  branches, stems of thoughts and notes are never deleted. They evolve and  they grow with you throughout your life. They are   real , they are   physical ,  they are an extension of you, and they become a part of you. The Antinet  becomes your   second mind   with whom you can   communicate   with. Again,  this is something missing in digital notetaking apps.  The   communication   component of the Zettelkasten is critical. Luhmann  believed this himself, which is why he titled his paper “ Communication  with Noteboxes .” As one of the inventors of systems theory, Luhmann said  he regards both himself and his Zettelkasten as “systems” and joked that  “no one will be surprised [by this].” 3   He says this jokingly because he’s one  of the first and major proponents of applying systems theory to the field of  sociology. Yet, Luhmann goes on to explicitly say that “systems theory” is not  his choice to begin explaining the Zettelkasten system. Rather, he chooses a  “communication theory” to explain what his Zettelkasten actually is.  The idea of a notebox system emerging into an external instantiation of  one’s own communication partner did not originate with Niklas Luhmann.  Rather, “this idea actually dates back to a situation already described in 1805 by  Heinrich von Kleist in his impressive analysis of the ‘midwifery of thought.’” 4  If you’re going to create something valuable, it requires deep thought, sophis -  ticated ideas, and deep connections. This type of thinking is achieved through  writing. Period.  Since the hardest part is the actual writing (and thinking) it is useful to then  transform the process into something that will grow and evolve forever.  3   Niklas Luhmann, “Communicating with Slip Boxes,” accessed May 4, 2021, https://luh -  mann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes.  4   Markus Krajewski,   Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice of a Counter-Measurement  against Forgetting   (Brill, 2016), 325.
166      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  It also becomes worthwhile for your structure to grow and develop its own  unique personality.  Writing this book on the Antinet Zettelkasten would be a much different  experience and would yield different ideas if I were to write it using the same  section of my notes ten years from now. In other words, due to the internal  branching nature, my current Antinet will inevitably evolve and grow inter -  nally over the years. The Antinet, just like a person, grows in unique ways,  and there’s so much richly packed knowledge that it will yield surprising  ideas for years to come. This is exciting, as the Antinet presents itself as a  goldmine of knowledge waiting to be stumbled upon and used some time  in the future, whether that be a year from now or ten years from now.  As Luhmann observed, one of the greatest benefits of communication is  that each partner can mutually surprise the other with unexpected insight. 5  When you’re using an Antinet, you’re essentially having a conversation  with it as you’re perusing its contents. After you look up the location of an  idea in the index, you then embark upon the process of sifting through the  cards in the area your index pointed you to. From there, you’re reading your  own thoughts in your own handwriting and trying to decipher what that  internal voice is saying. Along the way, you’re challenging one another. You  come across a card and question its bold claims; yet, upon a closer look you  actually realize that its claims are right and you’re wrong! This is like any  high-yielding real-life communication experience. You debate one another  and are sometimes proven wrong, which is a good thing!  In the several companies I’ve started, I’ve found some of the greatest innova -  tions to come about through just random conversation. My former business  partner and I would have lengthy and profound discussions. We would both  end up revising and updating our initial perspectives and come up with truly  brilliant ideas. This type of experience is something that seems to happen  when using an analog Zettelkasten. It’s one of those incommunicable truths  that one must experience for themselves to truly grasp.  5   “Communicating with Slip Boxes by Niklas Luhmann,” accessed May 4, 2021, https://  luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes.
167 A NALOG     What Luhmann meant by   communication with noteboxes   relates to having a  conversation with one’s Antinet. This concept is similar to having a conver -  sation with the author of a book that you read. As Mortimer Adler points out  in his classic work titled   How to Read a Book , reading a book is very much a  communication experience . In the book Adler lays out an analogy of a pitcher  and catcher in baseball. 6   The pitcher (the book author) is throwing you a  thought   (which is the baseball). You, the reader, are the catcher. A baseball  catcher is active,   not   passive. He’s actively anticipating the pitch, ready to  adjust to it and adjusts in order to receive it. Communication is not a vege -  tative experience. The same holds true for reading. It’s not like sitting down  on the couch, binge watching whatever is popular on Netflix. It’s a very alert  process. This is what it’s like working with an Antinet.  ANALOG CAPTURES ONE’S CONSCIOUSNESS  BETTER THAN DIGITAL  Another instance of analog serving as a pro over digital revolves around  capturing consciousness .  The Antinet Zettelkasten unlocks the type of communication relationship  Luhmann referenced in “ Communication with Noteboxes .” The Antinet  Zettelkasten captures your own consciousness, your own past self, in a way  that outshines digital Zettelkasten systems because it is truly a partner in  a communication relationship between   your current self   and   your past self .  Alberto Cevolini writes: “Compared with the rhetorical storehouse, the  card index preserves a knowledge—we could also say,   a past —that not only  continually changes but also can be recalled in a highly selective manner.” 7  When you go digital, you’re quite literally destroying the magic of the Anti -  net, stripping the system of the person and personality that lives inside it.  6   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev. and updated  ed (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 5.  7   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016),  32.

168      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  When I read my handwritten notes from fifteen years ago, they feel much  more   real   than any digital notes I took fifteen years ago (which, believe it or  not, are harder for me to find than my physical notes). When I come across  handwritten notes from fifteen years ago, I see myself in the handwriting.  I see a different version of myself. A past version of myself. My mind is  transported into that state, much like a song transports you into some state  you were in when you first heard it.  For instance, take the album by Coldplay titled   X & Y   (yes, I admit, I once  listened to Coldplay). Anyway, when I hear a song from the album today,  it transports me to the summer of 2005 when I was listening to it on vaca -  tion with my family in Hawaii. A similar phenomenon happens when you  interact with handwritten notes. You’re transported to the time and place  you first read the book and took the note. With each handwritten note, you  also transcribe a piece of your own consciousness—your own state and  self-awareness—onto the card. This does not seem to happen in the same  way with digital systems.  This argument may sound like woo-woo mysticism, but I assure you it’s  not. Scholars are familiar with this notion and Luhmann himself certainly  felt this was true. 8   This is noteworthy since Luhmann’s “ Communication  with Noteboxes”   is heralded as “the most advanced result of a long-lasting  reflection performed by modern society.” 9  In a thorough and deeply cogent paper on Luhmann’s Zettelkasten, Johannes  Schmidt “investigates the origins and development of Luhmann’s filing  technique in detail, also availing himself of first-hand information about  the content of this exceptional filing cabinet.” 10   From this paper, Alberto  Cevolini concludes that Schmidt’s paper “demonstrates that Luhmann did  8   “ZK II: Note 9 / 8.3 - Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed January 11, 2022,   https://niklas-  luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8-3_V .  9   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 26.  10   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016), 26.
169 A NALOG     not regard his filing cabinet as a simple slip box, rather   he interacted with it  as if it were a true communication partner .” 11  The reason handwritten notes produce the   ghost in the box effect   (that is,  preserving your past self) seems to emanate from one thing: consciousness.  Handwritten notes capture your own experience, sentiments, and sentience  at the time you wrote your thoughts on the card.  Knowledge = meaning x information . Knowledge is dependent on internal  dialogue between you and your past self. That is, knowledge deepens  during the intrapersonal communication process with your past self ’s  consciousness. When you read your old notes, in your own handwriting,  oftentimes there is   meaning   that is communicated through the notes that  only   you , its creator, can understand. This transitions the note from being  just   information   to being a unit of   knowledge   ( information   combined with  meaning ). Analog systems with handwritten notes seem to retain their  meaning better than commoditized, non-unique digital typefaces. With  digital systems, you can never be 100% absolutely certain that it was indeed  you who wrote the text. After all, the content could have been copied and  pasted. With your own longhand handwriting, the spirit of your past self  is much harder to spoof.  ANALOG TRANSFORMS THE ZETTELKASTEN  INTO A THINKING TOOL (BOTH SHORT-TERM  AND LONG-TERM)  [Luhmann’s Zettelkasten] served him as a thinking tool.  This is not only true in terms of the proposition that the file  acted as a communication partner in the research process but  also in regard to the fact that in Luhmann’s mind the process  of writing things down enables disciplined thinking in the  11   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016),  26.

The tool enhances thoughts in the short term through the process of forcing  one to think by writing by hand. As Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Richard  Feynman once said, “you have to work on paper.” 13   Or take Alexander Gro -  thendieck, a leading figure in the creation of modern algebraic geometry. In  watching Grothendieck work, one person observed, “[Grothendieck] was  improvising, in his fast and elegant handwriting. He said that   he couldn’t  think without writing .” 14  In the long term, the Antinet (the   thinking tool ) grows by way of its tree-like  internal branching structure, with more and more handwritten thoughts  linking together and creating new related stems. As mentioned, this essen -  tially transforms the Antinet into a new entity altogether—a second mind.  Both the short term component of the thinking tool, and the long-term  component of the thinking tool rely on the analog nature of the Antinet.  12   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner,   Publication   Machine,”   Forgetting   Machines.

171 A NALOG     NOTECARDS’ LIMITED SPACE FORCE UNLIMITED  COMBINATIONS OF THOUGHT  I’m not a fan of   synthetic   atomicity. Take for instance, the previously men -  tioned   atomic design methodology   which entails thinking of website compo -  nents as atoms, molecules, organisms, etc. 15   Such a paradigm overcomplicates  the already overcomplicated field of web development. Digital Zettelkasten  workflow warriors have jumped on this bandwagon, with people synthetically  trying to make their notes   atomic   by arbitrarily breaking them into smaller  parts. However, with most digital Zettelkasten systems, there’s no actual size  constraint, such as a character limit, like one would find in Twitter.  For instance, Sönke Ahrens in   How to Take Smart Notes   writes, “I highly rec -  ommend treating a digital note as if the space were limited… Each note should  fit onto the screen and there should be no need of scrolling.” 16   The problem  with such advice is that, after some time, it’s too easy to forget to follow it.  Notecards are different. There is an actual, physically limited, space into  which one must condense thoughts. The limited notecard space forces true  atomicity, unlike inadequately implemented digital notetaking apps.  Here’s why this is important: scholars studying the field of knowledge argue  that atomic knowledge (“dismembered” into notecards) creates combina -  tory power by way of “links and cross-references” that allow users to “shift  their cognitive energies (newly relieved of the burden of memorization) to  processing information.” 17  The   shift   in cognitive energies does not happen because one is completely  relieved of having to memorize anything (as in the case of storing thoughts  in a digital notetaking app). Rather, with analog systems, the   shift   happens  15   “Atomic Design Methodology | Atomic Design by Brad Frost,” accessed July 15, 2021,  http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/.  16   Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing,  Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers (North  Charleston, SC: CreateSpace, 2017), 129-130.  17   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 16.
172      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  because you’ve actually stamped the knowledge into your mind by way of  neuroimprinting the knowledge on your mind. This provides you with a  working memory of knowledge you can carry with you as you read more  material. The name of the game isn’t about offloading thoughts; it’s about  neuroimprinting thoughts. This feature, combined with the character limits  of notecards, is a great advantage of analog systems.  It’s a paradox. The slower pace required to use an analog Zettelkasten results  in a decrease in the number of items put into the system; it simply takes  longer to add the same amount of information one might add to a digital  system. The same applies to the processing of the information put into  each system. With the analog system, more time is required to convert the  material you read into knowledge by adding your own reformulations and  reflections—something not commonly undertaken in the digital versions.  Yet here’s where the paradox emerges. The workflow of the analog system  (which takes more time to consume and process less information), actually  results in producing a greater   quantity   of output in less time, compared with  digital systems. Also, the   quality   of the output outshines output produced  by digital notetaking systems.
173 A NALOG     There are two key factors that enable the paradoxical occurrence of greater  work output from an analog system that slows work down: (1) neuroim -  printing enables a more robust working memory when writing and creating  output, and (2) the character limit of analog systems enable combinatorial  possibilities in perpetuity that thereby enable more content to be generated  from the same units of knowledge (namely, from the same notecards).  ANALOG PREVENTS HYPER-SELECTION OF  IRRELEVANT MATERIAL WHILE READING  The most critical aspect of notetaking is not what to select from the material  you read; it’s what   not   to select from the material you read. According to  Fiona McPherson, a cognitive scientist specializing in the study of Note-  taking, the “most crucial” part of the entire process revolves around   selection .  By selection she is referring to determining what information is important,  and just as critically,   not selecting information that is not important . 18  For this reason, tools that help you to   not   select irrelevant information prove  advantageous. The Antinet shines in this respect due to the time and effort  required to select material by writing it down by hand (in the process of  extracting worthwhile notes and writing them down on a bibcard). This  takes much more effort than merely highlighting somewhat interesting  passages on a Kindle (something I did before discovering the Antinet). This  extraction and selection process ends up increasing your focus while reading,  so that you soon adopt a habit of selecting only the most truly meaningful  ideas from the material you read.  Analog systems are “highly selective,” as the scholar Alberto Cevolini points out.  Its selectivity is a feature, not a bug. Handwriting text is harder than typing text.  It takes longer. It forces “selectivity” in the system. “It would be meaningless  to move the whole content of a book into [a Zettelkasten],” writes Cevolini. 19  With digital systems, it’s trivial to extract and store information from the  18   Fiona McPherson,   Effective Note-taking , revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 13.  19   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016), 31.

The bad information crowds out the good. This is another reason analog  systems outshine digital.  ANALOG ENABLES ONE TO COMPARE,  CONTRAST, AND ORGANIZE THOUGHTS  BETTER THAN DIGITAL  As Sönke Ahrens observes, “to have concrete notes in front of our eyes and  be able to compare them directly makes differences, even small ones, much  easier to spot.” 20  I couldn’t have written this book without the aid of laying out all of the  different sections on my desk. I created a hub of cards that had collective  cardlinks on them. Each card was organized by topic and contained subtopics  that pointed me to various card addresses in my Antinet. I then moved them  around a large table to create the perfect logical layout for this book. Here’s  a picture of it:  20   Sönke Ahrens,   How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning  and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers   (North Charleston,  SC: CreateSpace, 2017), 122.
175 A NALOG     To write the book, I simply proceeded card-by-card and column-by-column.  Each card contained its own numeric-alpha address in the top-right corner  so that they could later be refiled in my Antinet. Here’s a closer look:  In the past, I’ve used analogous digital tools like Trello, Scrivener and others  to organize information. None came close to my experience of physically  working with knowledge. By moving around the individual units on a table,  writing my book became a much easier task. This is but another overlooked  advantage of analog knowledge systems.
176      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  ANALOG FORCES ONE TO FOLLOW BEST  PRACTICES  One of the other benefits of an analog system centers on the fact that it  forces one to follow best practices and guidelines brought forth by digital  Zettelkasten teachers. For instance, one author teaching digital Zettelkasten  recommends linking and rewriting notes in order to make notetaking less  boring. 21   This advice is a   recommendation   for digital Zettelkasten users. For  analog Zettelkasten users, it’s a   requirement . There’s no other choice. There  seems to be confusion among digital Zettelkasten practitioners about this.  Every single time you install a card in the Antinet, you’re effectively linking  it to all other cards in the system. You give it a numeric-alpha address that  provides it with a chained location in your tree of knowledge. It’s essentially  linked to its closest neighbors, and their closest neighbors, and their closest  neighbors, and on and on.  With digital Zettelkasten systems, developers devise synthetic rules and  methodologies to improvise for their own best practices. Digital Zettelkasten  systems have jury-rigged guidelines and principles that are all but impossi -  ble to follow because they require near-perfect self-discipline to stick with.  With the Antinet, no self-discipline is required. The best practices of linking  every note and rewriting and rephrasing ideas is built into the core protocol  of analog systems.  In brief, Digital Zettelkasten systems rely on willpower to function.  If you’re using a system that relies on personal willpower, it’s inevitable that  a breakdown will occur at some point. With the Antinet, this is not an issue.  ANALOG EXPOSES YOUR OWN MISTAKES AND  SELF-DECEPTIONS MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN  DIGITAL  Modern society’s most fundamental metaphorical symbol for   good vs. evil  is the biblical   tree of knowledge . Like the biblical tree of knowledge, your  own tree of knowledge that you create in the Antinet is susceptible to   evil  21   David Kadavy, Digital Zettelkasten: Principles, Methods, & Examples (Kadavy, Inc.,  2022), 14-15.
177 A NALOG     information. Actually, let’s not call it   evil   information, but   unwise   information.  The unwise information I speak of does not derive from cunning serpents  tempting you to eat a fruit. 22   Rather, the   unwise   information I speak of derives  from a different beast altogether: yourself!  Indeed, when you review the thoughts of your mind and happen upon a  view or opinion you no longer hold as true, it’s extremely difficult to delude  yourself into believing you never held such an opinion. Why? Because it’s  staring you in the face— in your own handwriting .  You see, your Antinet, your own tree of knowledge, contains   both   wise fruit  and unwise fruit (or good fruit vs. evil fruit).  On one hand, it’s important to express your thoughts and ideas   truly   with  conviction and self-belief. As Charlie Munger says, “Never underestimate  the man who overestimates himself.” 23   As Gary Halbert, the best copywriter  who ever lived puts it, “Nothing is impossible for the man who refuses to  listen to reason.” 24   While certainly containing some truth, both Munger’s  and Halbert’s statements communicate the jocoserious reality implanted  within their words. At one level, Munger and Halbert were advocating for  their readers to believe in themselves; yet, at another level they were warning  of the power wielded in doing so.  Taken to the extreme, self-belief quickly can transform into self-delusion.  “The simple truth,” as Munger puts it, “is that we aren’t adapted to face the  world as it is today.” He goes on to outline how critical the   environment   was  for shaping the traits of our ancestors. “We can learn to push our minds into  22   Robert Alter, ed., The Hebrew Bible: A Translation with Commentary, First edition  (New York; London: W.

It comes down to  one thing, according to Munger: “self-deception.” 25  Systems that expose us to our own self-deception and mistakes in thinking  are far more valuable than systems that conceal such things.  Analog Stamps Your Mistakes In Time (And This is a  Good Thing)  There is a saying dating back to at least 1915, “Everybody makes mistakes—  that’s why they put erasers on pencils.” 26   I first heard this saying from my  dad. However, when he recited it to me, I found myself disagreeing with a  small but important component of it. My position is that, while it’s useful to  erase mistakes, there is an even more valuable exercise   in not using an eraser  at all ! Instead, it’s better to append new, corrected information behind or  under the initial mistake. That way, you can view a history of your mistakes  and see your growth. It also serves as a useful tool in the future for reviewing  your past mistakes.  Why are mistakes valuable? Because they curb the risk of a grandiosity.  Charlie Munger says it best: “I like people admitting they were complete  stupid horses’ asses. I know I’ll perform better if I rub my nose in my mis -  takes. This is a wonderful trick to learn.” 27  After stating my case against erasers, my mom chimed in and backed me on  this. Of course my dad wasn’t arguing for the literal idea of forgetting about  your mistakes. Neither was the original quote stating this. The quote about  erasers argues that you should be OK making mistakes. This is 100% accu -  rate.

It’s humbling, it’s  deflating, but after a while, you start to develop a thick skin.  The power of the Antinet is that it stamps your mistakes in a capsule of time.  You then view the evolution of your own self-deception in order to not fall  into the trap of making similar mistakes again.  With digital systems, it’s all-too-easy to simply overwrite or delete your  own mistakes.  As Johannes Schmidt observes of Luhmann’s Antinet:  It contains not only validated knowledge but also reflects  the thought process, including potential mistakes and blind  alleys that were later revised but not removed from the file  as the original cards always remained in Luhmann’s file and  perhaps a new card with revisions was added if needed. 28  As the scholar, Markus Krajewski, writes of using an analog Zettelkasten,  “The reader is not only reading his own memory, but rather also his shifting  frame of reference over time.” 29   Thus, when you review your own notes  (in your own handwriting), you have changing perspectives that shift over  time. You can view your “less complex” thoughts and how they’ve changed,  developed and internally   evolved   over a long period.  Most surprising are the links stamped onto the cards at the moment you wrote  them that shed light on what the past version of you was thinking at the time  when you wrote them. “What is more surprising are the references listed.” 30  28   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

180      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Here’s an example from my own life. I once confused the terms   prospection  and   proprioception .  Prospection is the concept of creating mental representations about the  future (or possible future scenarios). Proprioception refers to your body’s  ability to sense movement, action, or its location.  This is one of my older notes (on a 3 x 5 inch card; for newer notes I use  4 x 6 inch cards). It’s a   reformulation   note I took from reading the book,  Sapiens . The card address is 2714/4:  In the bottom left-hand corner I added an update in green ink (which tells  me it’s a new comment I added long after making the card): “Error,” and in  blue ink I include the cardlink: 3525/2A. 31   If we navigate to card 3525/2A,  we find the following:  31   Note: I don’t use blue ink anymore; I only use black ink (for main notes), red ink (for  references), and green ink (for   both   comments and cardlinks).
181 A NALOG     Immediately linked to this card (by way of the tree internal branching  structure), I find an old card 3525/2.  Aha! This is what I thought of originally when I wrote the first card (2714/4),  but I couldn’t quite recall where the idea came from, or what the term I  was thinking of was. When I initially wrote 2714/4, I made the mistake of  confusing the term   proprioception   with   prospection , a concept I first learned  about in the book   Stumbling on Happiness .
182      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Locking this mistake into a permanent state then allows me to communicate  that such terms are sometimes confused. For instance, when writing a piece  that happens to use the concept of   prospection   in the future, I could start  with something like,   A term sometimes confused with proprioception is that of  prospection, which means X, whereas proprioception means Y . Stamping such a  mistake permanently in the Antinet helps me refresh and re-remind myself  of the confusion in order to prevent the mistake from occurring again. Even  more powerful, however, is the opportunity this creates for an accidental  breakthrough and creative insight. For instance, I could ask myself,   How are  the concepts of proprioception related?   Interestingly enough, they are somewhat  related. Proprioception involves the mental representation of your   present  self ; whereas prospection relates to the mental representation of your   future  self . We can then explore why this may be the case by digging into the ety -  mology of the terms. Before you know it, you’re embarking on a journey of  going deep into a field of knowledge that fascinates you. Inevitably you’ll  end up with much richer insights than is typically found taking digital notes.  There are ways to jury-rig such a system in digital form (using Git, for  instance). However, I find that such solutions are an afterthought. They  may expose the “change history” of a note or a document; however the  feature is usually placed to the side of the screen of the main note. Even  then, it requires manual digging and clicking to reveal the commit history  (or change history0 of the note. With an Antinet, such a feature is baked  into the core protocol of the system.  ANALOG ENABLES YOU TO GAIN BETTER  FAMILIARITY WITH YOUR KNOWLEDGE  Another key property of the Antinet is revealed by Luhmann’s familiarity  with his own tree of knowledge. Luhmann knew his Zettelkasten like the  back of his hand. His knowledge was permanently stamped onto his mind.  One critical aspect of becoming a “publication machine” is how well you  know your way around your knowledge. Johannes Schmidt does not overlook  this factor, observing Luhmann “engaged in an ongoing process of tending  to his file.” 32   The extensive time he spent doing this resulted in him gaining  32   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication
183 A NALOG     a deep understanding of his knowledge. For a thirty-plus year repository of  information, one would think there would be a detailed table of contents  to help him navigate; however, “Luhmann never created a detailed table  of contents.” 33  Luhmann benefitted greatly by being essentially forced to work with his  knowledge as it accumulated (due to the Zettelkasten’s analog nature, and  there being no search feature). This critical property allowed him to store  deeply interconnected and complex information. It helped him integrate  new ideas, all while gracefully navigating his mind and memory (past and  present). He would insert newly acquired information into the appropriate  place which resulted in deeply evolved thoughts.  How did Luhmann achieve such a deeply imprinted “groove” of his thoughts?  There’s several ways. First, his ideas were neuroimprinted on his mind due  to the analog nature of the system. Second, he developed rapid recall of  information from the deep web-like network embedded in the analog system.  He developed this faculty by   engaging in the ongoing process of tending to his  Antinet . 34   When you partake in this process, it’s very much distinct from  the process of reviewing digital files. Reviewing digital files can cause your  eyes to glaze over. You forget what you’re searching for and soon become  distracted by other things.  With the Antinet, searching for notes becomes a fun, active process, during  which you think about and have a conversation with the material. You often  find yourself challenging your notes, or, trying to understand the context  that led you to write a particular thought. Most important, the process builds  your memory in such a way that you and all of your thoughts and learnings  Partner,   Publication   Machine,”   Forgetting   Machines.

For me, this was an unexpected hidden benefit of analog. In retrospect,  however, it’s pretty obvious. You build out your brain’s memory constantly  without feeling like it’s a chore.  In my time using digital notetaking apps, I forced such a practice upon myself  using a plugin that opened a random note. This didn’t last long. Opening a  random note every day felt like a chore, and I quickly dropped the practice.  A more effective method, which I’ve stuck with for over a decade, is the  practice of reviewing a random chunk notecards. I would randomly sift  through my reading notes and allow the concepts I had previously read to  reverberate through my mind.  Still, it requires self-discipline and seems to wane after some time. However,  in working with an Antinet, one reviews thoughts automatically while search -  ing for ideas. It’s a lot more fun. It’s less of a chore, and it always introduces  opportunities for surprises.  The ability to rapidly learn and later retrieve novel associations, memories,  and information is an important ability. In fact, it’s a core part of what  makes us human. This is why such a feature is so important in the Antinet.  As Michael Kahana states, one’s ability to recall and associate ideas is “an  important tool in coping effectively with one’s environment.” 35  Yet in our era of rapidly expanding digital technology, with regard to human  memory, people seem to throw logic and rationality out the window. That  same Kahana also points out that having a good memory may not be all that  important for the ultimate survival of the species due to our “present era of  personal-data assistants and Google’s vast searchable databases.” 36  35   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory.

Developing your memory  and your ability to recognize patterns when learning new information   is  critical—and likely will remain critical—at the least for noteworthy success  in your field. Analog systems enhance this faculty; digital systems seem less  effective in doing so.  OTHER PROS OF ANALOG SYSTEMS  One concept you’ll learn about in this book is what is termed   external  context   in the field of human memory studies. External context introduces  properties that can later help you recall information and knowledge. These  things include parts of your sensory system—sounds, tastes, textures, etc. 37  These properties are found in analog systems; they are not native to digital  systems. In a later section I talk about how I retrieve certain memories and  ideas based on the external context and cues generated by certain notecards.  Digital systems do not possess such features.  The Science Behind Analog Systems Developing  Knowledge  The premise of analog systems aiding in the development of your mind  (compared with digital systems) can be explained by the latest research in the  study of human memory. With analog systems, you’re constantly in a state  of   recognition , reviewing thoughts found in your own system and trying to  recognize   the core idea behind the concept. When you read new information  you’re also trying to recognize the core idea behind the concept.  When you recognize a concept, thought, or idea, two processes occur within  your mind.  First, the   familiarity process   kicks into gear. When you think of the concept  or idea, a value of your confidence in the familiarity of the content that arises  emerges. It’s essentially a   confidence value   of how confident you are and how  Press, 2014), 112.  37   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory. (New York: Oxford University  Press, 2014), 12.
186      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  familiar you are with a thought. This concept comprises something called  strength theory   in human memory.  The second process is the   recollection process . The recollection process involves  the recall of   contextual information   related to the content of the thought.  For exceptional knowledge work, it’s critical to exercise your mind’s recogni -  tion ability—that is, the faculty for recognizing concepts, thoughts, and ideas.  This is critical because it allows you to do two things when reading a text:  First, it enables you to create   information   by way of   comparison . As Luh -  mann writes:  Information is an intra-systematic event. It results when one  compares one message or entry with regard to other possi -  bilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems  which possess a comparative schema—even if this amounts  only to: “this or something else.” 38  By neuroimprinting concepts in your mind, you’re effectively enabling a  working memory store of knowledge to   compare   with new ideas that you  come across in your reading. You then set off a process of comparing the idea  from your readings with the knowledge already stored in your Antinet. You  cannot install a new piece of knowledge in your Antinet without comparing  it to your current knowledge. You’re forced to find   the most similar   location  wherein that knowledge should be installed. With digital systems, this is  not a requirement. Digital does not force the   comparison   process into every  single note before it’s created.  Second, by exercising your ability to recollect concepts, you are forced to  relate information to a   selective   set of other   relations   (a process necessary to  create knowledge, and through action, wisdom).  38   “Communicating with Slip Boxes by Niklas Luhmann,” accessed May 4, 2021, https://  luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes.
187 A NALOG     To summarize, the analog nature of the Antinet develops the mind’s faculties  for   recollecting   and   recognizing   interesting patterns while reading. This allows  you to make connections to material ruminating in your second mind.  Familiarity   is developed through writing longhand, and it is furthered due  to the system not having a search feature. There’s no other choice but to  actively review and work with your knowledge.  Recollection   emerges through developing your thoughts   within contexts  (i.e., branches, stems and areas within your tree of knowledge).  As some scholars have observed, both of these variables paradoxically  transform notetaking from a system designed to store memories into a sys -  tem that both stores   and   enhances memories. “[Handwritten] notetaking  [due to repetition that helped the mind retain passages] and the respective  construction of a card index were considered both a substitute for personal  memory and a memory aid.” 39  This phenomenon may not be exclusive to analog systems, however I argue  that it’s more common in analog systems because analog systems   force  the occurrence of familiarity and recollection, even if it’s inconvenient  (it’s much more convenient to use the search box of a digital notetaking app).  Luhmann talked about   generalizing   concepts and abstracting them out in such  a way as to create containers of insight later on. He highlighted the practice  of creating answers to specific questions that he could ask his Antinet. For  instance, Luhmann posed the following question:   why are museums empty,  whereas exhibits of paintings by Monet, Picasso, or Medici are too crowded?  The answer seems to revolve around exhibits being short-term events—  they’re “temporally limited.” Luhmann then created the following index  entry: “preference for what is temporally limited.” This allowed Luhmann  to accumulate more cards that exhibit a   preference for what is temporally  39   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 24.

From there he could spot patterns and propose a  theory for why certain things occur.  This is a deliberate process. It takes work and effort to create. There’s no  magical future   to surface such insights. Cutesy bubble graphs of notes won’t  magically surface such insights. Neither will the so-called “power of digital  search.”  Let’s talk briefly about the notion concerning the power of digital search.  In reality, the power of digital search is a myth. Due to search functionality,  digital notetaking systems possess less impetus to exercise the recognition  faculty of one’s mind. With analog, you’re forced to deliberately create pat -  terns in your mind as well as shortcuts for concepts to spot later on. This is  yet another advantage of analog systems.  These are the pros of working with an analog system. These strengths have  emerged from my own experience working with an Antinet for over a year,  and from my research into analog thinking systems. There are other posi -  tive aspects that are more obvious; however, I won’t bother going into the  obvious ones in detail. It’s best to experience them for yourself by testing  the Antinet for yourself. That’s the fun part, anyway!  Let’s now discuss the cons of analog.  THE CONS OF ANALOG  There are no cons of analog.  Just kidding! There are a number of negative aspects that arise while working  with analog systems. Let’s go through them now.  40   “Communicating with Slip Boxes by Niklas Luhmann,” accessed May 4, 2021, https://  luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes.
189 A NALOG     ANALOG FACES THE RISK OF DESTRUCTION DUE  TO FIRE, FLOOD, OR OTHER DISASTER  At least once a week I get the following type of comment on Reddit or my  YouTube channel:   Yeah, sounds great Scott, but what about a fire or flood?  It’s a valid question. Many of history’s greatest minds who used analog  knowledge systems suffered the downside of losing their archive to fire or  flood. For instance, Thomas Jefferson’s personal library and notes were the  casualty of a house fire, causing him great despair. 41   The same happened to  Aldous Huxley in his later years when a brushfire broke out at his California  home. He rushed in and saved his manuscript of the book he was working  on at the time ( The Island ). 42   Unfortunately his personal library of four  thousand books was engulfed by the flames.  There’s no denying that a downside of analog centers around its risk of  destruction (due to fire, flood, or other natural disaster). But is it really  enough risk to warrant opting for digital over analog? I think not.  Here’s one way to think of this: would you rather live a life possessing  something extremely valuable that can be lost, or, would you rather possess  something that is worth less without risk of loss? Note: I contend that digital  notes are not   worthless ; but they are   worth less   in that they contain   less worth  than analog notes. The reason centers on the thought that is poured into notes  written by hand. They are worth more. They take more time, they require  more attention, and they are created at greater expense than digital notes.  Like any good hero’s journey, after you spend months or years building your  own Antinet, you’ll experience the moment of realizing where the value  truly resides. The value of the Antinet and its analog notes does not reside  in the cabinets in which you store your thoughts. Rather, the value resides in  how your brain develops and changes. Working with an analog system like  the Antinet transforms the way that you think. In essence, the true value of  41   Jon Meacham, Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power, Illustrated edition (New York, NY:  Random House Trade Paperbacks, 2013).  42   Dana Sawyer, Aldous Huxley: A Biography (Trillium Press, 2015), 182.
190      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  the Antinet is not its physical material, it’s the metaphysical material that it  creates. The value is in what the analog system does to your mind, not the  actual contents of the box itself.  This mirrors that moment in the hero’s journey wherein the hero has victory  in his or her sights. Yet the hero foregoes crossing the finish line because his  friend who had helped him on the journey (and who the hero may be in  conflict with) is suddenly in trouble. In this moment, the hero realizes the  physical prize is   worth less   than the fulfillment and love of relationships and  connection with others (i.e., the metaphysical prize). In other words, the  hero chooses fulfillment over achievement. With this realization, the hero  comes to understand that life isn’t about struggling for the external physical  item signifying achievement. Rather, life is about the fulfillment of internal  metaphysical qualities (such as virtue, growth, challenge and self-respect).  I realize this may sound sappy and ridiculous, especially in the context of  reading a book about developing knowledge using notecards, but I assure  you there’s truth in this notion. The true value of the Antinet journey is  not in the external physical knowledge; it’s what the process of developing  the knowledge does to your mind. If my Antinet burned down, I’d do two  things: (1) I’d sit down and write furiously to finish the project I was in  the middle of, while the knowledge was still fresh, and (2) I’d start a new  Antinet. It’s that simple.  That’s a metaphysical solution to analog’s risk of destruction due to disaster.  However, there’s also a physical solution. Fireproof and waterproof cabinets  exist and they’re quite effective. However, they aren’t cheap. They’re in the  same price range as a computer. Still, they are an option. If you live in an  area where you greatly fear the risk of damage and destruction, you can  certainly go this route.  For myself, I have not gone this route. I have thought about looking into  fireproof and waterproof cabinets built specifically for the Antinet’s note -  cards; however I have not done this yet at the time of this writing. For me,  I sleep soundly at night knowing my Antinet is stored in a safe office in a  nice building. It’s not without risk, yet it doesn’t keep me up at night.
191 A NALOG     Now, I would like to pose a counter-intuitive idea: the risk of destruction is  a good thing. I think there’s a subconscious component to my notes being  analog whereby I’m more motivated to turn my notes into a published prod -  uct. Because my notes stare me in the face (and there is a sizable amount of  notes to stare me in the face), I’m more motivated to actually sit down at the  computer and type them into my text editor. When my notes are converted  into text, it extinguishes the risk of fire (pun intended). The risk of fire or  water damage actually forces me to publish my work faster, and to turn it  into something useful more immediately.  To wrap things up, the risk of damage and destruction of notes due to fire,  flood, or other natural disaster is real—yet it’s also not real. It’s real in that  it can physically happen; yet it’s not real in that it cannot physically happen  unless your mind is destroyed by the fire, flood, or other disaster—and  that’s a different problem altogether! That’s a problem digital systems cannot  account for either.  ANALOG IS HARDER THAN DIGITAL  Another con of analog is that it’s harder than digital. It requires more effort,  time, and deliberate attention. More, it requires a greater quantity of work to  produce less. With digital notetaking systems, knowledge is easier to create.  It’s also cheaper to create. However, I contend that the extra effort and the  deeper thought processing is worth it. Oftentimes, the hard way is the best  way. In fact, it can be argued that it’s the only   true   way.  Writing by hand was valued by writers in the early modern period precisely  for the reason that it was hard. It sharpened not only their faculties for  controlling their   attention , but also improved their   retention   of material.  As scholar Anne Blair observes, writers used the process of writing by hand  as “a mental and physical discipline that sharpened attention and retention.”   43  For myself, using an analog system helps cure my ADHD-tendencies.

192      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  I feel almost sucked into the experience. I cannot pry myself away from my  desk until I finish the thought. This practice is certainly not exclusive to  analog; however, I find it more prevalent in analog. I also find my thoughts  to be better developed and processed when writing by hand. Much of this  book was written by hand using my Antinet. This sentence and this section  you’re reading right now, however, were not written by hand. I’m thinking by  typing on my computer (hypocrite)! While I do not think this is necessarily  a bad section, I do think it would have been much better and had a stronger  impact if I had taken the time to deliberately write it out by hand first. The  reason I have not done so is because the content backing much of what  I’m writing here will be covered in another section of this book (a section  on the power of writing by hand). So, essentially I have indeed written out  the core idea of this section (the power of writing by hand), yet I have not  specifically handwritten   this section . Still, I have deeply thought through the  core idea I’m writing about in this section. How so? Because I developed it  elsewhere through writing by hand.  Analog is harder than digital not only in terms of the effort it requires, but  in other ways as well. With an analog system, you must buy a variety of  materials. Blank notecards, boxes, containers, Wite-Out, pens, rulers, and  other items. That’s not too difficult, yet it does indeed require more space.  Analog systems also result in quizzical regard from others who see you using  such. They may question your sanity for investing so much time and energy  into boxes of physical notecards. If you aren’t strong-minded, you may even  end up questioning your own sanity!  Here’s The Truth: The Hard Way Is Better  One of the biggest myths about Zettelkasten centers around the tradeoff  between ease vs. effort. Here’s the truth: you must be prepared to do things  the hard way if you wish to produce great work. The paradox, however, is  that the hard way turns out to be the easy way. The up front hard work of  writing notes by hand later turns into the greatest benefit of the system.  As Mortimer Adler outlines in his classic   How to Read a Book , one must be  prepared to go about processing books the hard way. “That is the only way,”
193 A NALOG     Adler writes. “Without external help of any sort, you go to work on the book.  With nothing but the power of your own mind.” 44  After Ryan Holiday wrote a piece outlining his notebox system, he responded  to a question he is frequently asked: “Wouldn’t digital be easier?” Here’s  Holiday’s response:  Yes. But I don’t want this to be easy. Writing them [notes]  down by hand forces me to take my time and to go over  everything again (taking notes on a Kindle is too easy and  that’s the problem). Also being able to physically arrange stuff  is crucial for getting the structure of your book or project  right. I can move cards from one category to another. As I  shuffle through the cards, I bump into stuff I had forgotten  about, etc. 45  Holiday makes three important points here. One is the benefit of an analog  system enabling him to better develop his thoughts. The other is the benefit  of haptic factors utilized in knowledge management (that is, being able to  lay the cards out in front of you to physically rearrange). The last benefit  Holiday touches on is bumping into stuff he had forgotten about. Here  Holiday is describing   maintenance rehearsal   in human memory.  All of these aspects, admittedly the   hard way to do this , end up producing  better work. The hard way, paradoxically, becomes the best way.  The bottom line is that analog thinking systems are hard. They take more  time and energy investment than digital systems. They’re also less conven -  tional than digital systems, and thus suffer from an implicit bias that digital  systems are used by smarter people who are geeky enough to know shortcuts  44   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev. and updated  ed (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 7.  45   Ryan Holiday, “The Notecard System: The Key For Remembering, Organizing And  Using Everything You Read,” RyanHoliday.Net (blog), April 1, 2014, https://ryanhol -  iday.net/the-notecard-system-the-key-for-remembering-organizing-and-using-every -  thing-you-read/.
194      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  and hotkeys (rubbish). This is a false notion. There are no shortcuts. In fact,  the shortcuts end up falling far short of the desired destination: excellence.  ANALOG IS LESS MOBILE THAN DIGITAL (OR IS IT?)  Another con of analog centers around the perceived immobility of the sys -  tem. Its roots, once again, trace back to Sönke Ahrens. In   How to Take Smart  Notes , Ahrens says he chose to use a digital Zettelkasten for “mobility.” 46   His  presumption is that a laptop storing his notes is easier to carry than a filing  cabinet full of notecards. While this may be true, he’s actually making the  wrong comparison. Sure, a laptop carrying notes is more mobile than carrying  around filing cabinets full of notecards. However, they are not equivalent.  He mistakenly believes that the two are equal when, in reality, they are not.  An analog system like the Antinet contains thoughts and a structure of  knowledge that are irreplicable in a digital notetaking system. The knowledge  Ahrens carries with him on his laptop is of lesser value and worth than the  knowledge contained in a robust analog system.  In addition, the material you carry with you when using an analog system  does not just reside in the card boxes. The knowledge resides in your mind.  Such knowledge, when digitally managed, would otherwise not be stamped  in your mind in such a way. In effect, with the Antinet you carry knowledge  with you, wherever you go. Whether you’re in the shower (where break -  throughs in thinking actually happen), or whether you’re on your couch  reading, you carry with you knowledge that would otherwise be missing if  you used digital systems. In this way, it can be argued that digital systems  are   less   mobile than   analog   systems. Why? Because with analog systems,  you can carry more knowledge, internally, than you can with digital systems.  Plus digital notes result in cheaper, less processed knowledge stored in the  depths of a notetaking app.  46   Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing,  Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers (North  Charleston, SC: CreateSpace, 2017), 31.
195 A NALOG     ANALOG KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS VS.  DIGITAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS  As the data scientist John Foreman observes, machines can help us measure  the correlations and proximities between clusters of groups or individuals  who buy a particular item; however, they cannot tell us   why people do not  buy . 47   There is an internal experience (a   theory of mind ) that is invisible to  computers. Computers do not know what it’s like to be human. Humans do,  and there’s no replacement for this missing feature. I’d like to propose that  analog systems retain   humanness   better than digital systems. They seem to  also introduce the   understanding   of the internal human experience better  than digital systems.  Many people inappropriately compare digital and analog Zettelkasten sys -  tems. Even learned scholars deeply familiar with knowledge systems make  such a mistake. For instance, Markus Krajewski writes: “A critical advantage  lies in the fact that software based literary databases are not simply able to  remember, but can also be employed as   productive assistants   in the production  of arguments.” 48   The problem with this scholar’s assertion centers around  two things: First, Luhmann himself described his Zettelkasten as a personal  productive assistant. 49   And second, Krajewski does not explain   why   he holds  the view that a digital Zettelkasten can be a productive assistant whereas an  analog Zettelkasten cannot. 50  47   John W. Foreman, Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into  Insight (Indianapolis, IN: Wiley, 2014). There are a lot of reasons why someone does   not  take an action, but only a few reasons why someone does. This introduces the concept  of cosine distance, a mathematical method for determining the similarity between two  documents or vectors. Yet the problem still remains for computers: determining why  someone   did not   buy. These are creative problems that involve understanding the human  experience, which computers are not as capable of solving (compared with a marketer  who studies psychology, at least).  48   Markus Krajewski,   Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice of a Counter-Measurement  against Forgetting   (Brill, 2016), 322.  49   “ZK II: Zettel 9/8,1—Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,” accessed March 21, 2022,   https://  niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8-1_V .  50   Although perhaps it can be explained by the fact that he created a piece of software that  proposes to replace the need for an analog Note-taking system. Along these lines, the  scholar could be simply seeing his software through rose-colored glasses.
196      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  THE DOWNSIDES OF DIGITAL  Many seem to overlook the downsides of digital. We have a vague sense that  digital environments are distracting; however research is starting to show  us how distracting they actually are. For instance, one study tracked the  anonymous digital activity of fifty-thousand users. The results illustrated  that half of the users checked communication apps (like Slack and email)  “every six minutes or less.” 51  When you’re working, even if you have notifications turned off, a distract -  ing app is just a click away. This environment is not optimal for deep work  or writing.  Furthermore, the digital work environment has been shown to result in  suboptimal health.   The International Archives of Occupational and Environ -  ment Health   published a study that observed long-term trends of nearly five  thousand Swedish workers. The results showed a trend of suboptimal health  outcomes associated with high information and digital technology usage.  Other research shows that email is connected with unhappiness. In other  words, every six minutes or so when you’re looped into checking email, you’re  also looped into an activity that has been shown to cause unhappiness. 52  In brief, the digital environment appears to be more distracting and also leads  to less happiness and suboptimal health. Yet the digital work environment  is the very thing I find myself having to convince the majority of knowledge  workers to escape!  IF LUHMANN WERE ALIVE TODAY  One might be tempted to think that if Luhmann were alive today, he would  opt for a digital notetaking system. I have several reasons why I think he  would not.  51   Cal Newport, A World Without Email: Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication  Overload (New York: Portfolio, 2021), 11.  52   Cal Newport, A World Without Email: Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication  Overload (New York: Portfolio, 2021), 37.
197 A NALOG     First and foremost, Luhmann lived until 1998. Personal computers were  introduced in 1977 and became common in the 1980s. 53   It’s likely that an aca -  demic who was familiar with information science and systems theory would  be savvy enough to learn how a personal computer works. Yet Luhmann  never seemed to move to the digital medium for managing his knowledge.  In fact, later in his life (when computers were a more accessible option)  Luhmann wrote a piece titled   Learning to Read . In it, Luhmann introduced  various best practices for reading. He advised the taking of notes (not excerpts,  but reformulation notes), and he also advises readers to store those notes in  a computer or an analog Zettelkasten. 54   Even after parting with this advice,  Luhmann continued to use his analog Zettelkasten. Therefore, perhaps the  question is not whether Luhmann would choose digital if he were alive  today—after all, he already had that option. Rather the question becomes,  why did Luhmann choose to stick with his analog Zettelkasten? The pri -  mary reason centers on what his analog Zettelkasten became for Luhmann:  it became his   second mind .  There’s a continual fallacy that arises in confusing systems storing information  for others vs. systems that store knowledge for oneself. The same scholar  who calls digital systems   productive assistants   also asserts that slipboxes,  noteboxes (and Antinets), are for “internal use only.” 55  Luhmann’s goal, quite literally, centered on creating a productive assistant  to bounce ideas off of, and guess what…he achieved it with his analog  Zettelkasten. When given the choice to discard the second mind he cre -  ated (and opt for digital instead), Luhmann clearly made the right choice:  he chose his Antinet.  •   •   •  53   “Home Computer,” in Wikipedia, July 15, 2021, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?  title=Homecomputer&oldid=1033746593.  54   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 83.  55   Markus Krajewski,   Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice of a Counter-Measurement  against Forgetting   (Brill, 2016), 319.
198      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The physical, external properties that make such systems like the Antinet  more powerful than digital are becoming increasingly recognized by schol -  ars for their powerful features (when they’re not shockingly overlooked).  The best advertisement for an analog Zettelkasten is perhaps an article  titled “ Rank and File ,” in which the author professes awe for the intellectual  prowess of a professor who inspired him. 56   It turns out that this revered pro -  fessor used an analog system of notecards. The author attempted to employ  such a notetaking system in digital form, only to realize its shortcomings.  It’s rather head-scratching, but the author doesn’t then try an analog Zettelkas -  ten system. Instead, after his failure in making use out of a digital Zettelkasten,  the author gives up on the idea completely. It’s unfortunate. The only thing  he got wrong in his digital Zettelkasten was the digital part.  PEOPLE OF ANALOG  My uncle is an attorney based in Los Angeles, California. He was born to  be an attorney. He’s one of the rarer attorneys who is passionate, charming  (in his own mind), and most shocking of all, he’s an attorney who is not a  complete a-hole! He also has a steel trap for a memory. According to him, it’s  not that he has a good memory, it’s just that he can’t seem to forget things!  The things he remembers aren’t legal cases and practical stuff. They’re things  like football stats, player’s names and numbers, Heisman trophy winners  by year, the scores of every Super Bowl ever played, and more. He knows  every single winner of the Indianapolis 500, dating back to the year 1911. You  simply give him a year, and he’ll instantly tell you the name of the winner  and any other contextual details about the event.  On a recent Super Bowl Sunday we decided to watch the football game at  my parent’s home. A few hours before the game started, I decided to take a  break from being around company, and I found a quiet place in my father’s  home office where my father was working as well. At a separate desk, I began  making main notes from the bibcard I had created while reading Luhmann’s  book   Short Cuts . After some time, my uncle walked in to see what me and  my dad were up to.  56   “Rank and File,” Real Life, accessed January 14, 2022, https://reallifemag.com/rank  -and-file/.
199 A NALOG     My dad was up to his usual stuff: paying bills, returning emails from clients,  etc. However, my uncle turned to me and saw six notecards of main notes  scattered on my desk. “What the hell are you doing?” he asked. “Whoa,  that’s actually pretty good handwriting!” After giving him a surface-level  explanation of the notecard system and professing the power of writing by  hand, he replied, “That’s been my secret to success. Every opening statement  I’ve ever done in my legal career, I’ve written out by hand.”  I wouldn’t be surprised if writing things out by hand also stands key to his  steel trap memory.  The more I share the power of analog methods, of notecards, and writing by  hand, the more people I discover who use such tools. I get information sent  to me from my fellow Antinetters attesting to this. I also keep an eye out  while reading. I frequently spot people who reveal their secrets to revolve  around analog knowledge tools. When I do, I usually note them down.  For instance, take Ted Nelson, the godfather of hypertext documents and  hyperlinks who inspired the internet as we know it. One would expect him  to arrive at meetings with a laptop. Yet, he uses analog tools like notebooks,  notecards, sticky notes, and tape recorders. In a humorous account by Kevin  Kelly, the creator of Wired magazine, Kelly shares how Nelson arrived at  their meeting to outline the future with such tools. 57  One of the best marketers of all time is an old curmudgeon named Dan  Kennedy. He’s a character who sports a horseshoe mustache and a “No B.S.”  attitude (which also serves as the title for his book series). A central point  in his book   No B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs   focuses on creating  a “success environment” for oneself. This environment is to be stocked with  analog tools. He lists off tools including clocks, symbols of wealth, folders,  massive Ziploc bags for each project, and, of course, notecards. 58  57   Kevin Kelly, The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape  Our Future (New York, New York: Penguin Books, 2017).  58   Dan S.

200      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  On the very first page of   The Journals of Abraham Maslow   we find Maslow  stating the importance of managing his knowledge using analog tools and  3 x 5 inch notecards. 59  Indeed, the “soul” of Umberto Eco’s classic book,   How to Write a Thesis , is  his analog notecard system. 60  And then there’s John August, the screenwriter behind movies like   Big Fish ,  Charlie’s Angels ,   Titan A.E.   and   Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . What’s  the secret to August’s success? Writing his story down on notecards and  laying them out on a table. From there he organizes the story and develops  the screenplay. 61  F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote his novels by hand using paper and super sharp  pencils. He didn’t even erase his mistakes, preferring to cross them out. 62  His personal assistant later in his life observed how Fitzgerald would  write by hand every day (presumably even after recovering from his epic  gin-induced hangovers)! 63  Other people who use analog tools, including notecards, and who write by  hand include the following people: comedian Jerry Seinfeld, author Elizabeth  Gilbert, author Ryan Holiday, author Robert Greene, novelist Anne Lamott,  and writer Robert Caro (whom I talk about elsewhere in this book). 64   The  list goes on and on.

201 A NALOG     HISTORY’S GREATEST MINDS USED ANALOG  THINKING SYSTEMS LIKE THE ANTINET  A great many intellectuals of the past used tools like the Antinet, including  the German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz  (1646–1716). Around 1676 he built a so-called excerpt cabinet ( scrinium  literatum ). He was inspired by the Swiss physician and naturalist, Conrad  Gessner (1516–1565), who built a “humble paper-slip” system. 65   Gessner is  known as possibly the first person in history who is mentioned using an  Antinet-like system. 66   Other early adopters of an Antinet-like system include  Georg Philipp Harsdörffer (1607–1658) and Joachim Jungius (1587–1657).  The first English dictionary, famously built by Samuel Johnson, was assembled  using notecards. He sorted the dictionary entries into alphabetical order  and then glued them into a master manuscript. 67  I won’t risk boring you with a comprehensive history of people who used  Antinet-like systems.

THE POWER OF WRITING BY HAND  MY JOURNEY DISCOVERING THE POWER OF  WRITING BY HAND  One of the secrets to my success in college can be attributed to one thing:  writing by hand.  Many of my other peers brought their laptops to class. When the professor  began talking, they’d flip it open and take notes for a while, never looking  up to engage with the professor. After some time, they’d open up a new  68   For Antinet-like systems and the people who used them, see pages: 30–33, 41–42, 49, 78,  and 230.

I always had only one thing in front of me. Actually, two: a Five Star spiral  notebook, and a pen.  One reason why I never brought a laptop to class was that it felt disrespectful  to the professor. They can’t see what you’re doing, and they have no way of  telling if you’re just flat-out ignoring them. There you have a person dedi -  cating their life to teaching you something, and you’re staring into a screen,  seemingly ignoring them. It just didn’t sit right with me.  That said, the feeling of being disrespectful to the professor wasn’t the only  reason I didn’t bring a laptop. I didn’t bring a laptop to class for several  other reasons.  First, by taking notes by hand, you end up   understanding   the material better  (as research now confirms). 69   When you write by hand, you’re thinking and  understanding in a way that is more effective than taking notes using a laptop.  Second, when you write by hand, you end up paying very close attention  to the physical cues of the professor or lecturer. You’re better able to filter  out what’s truly important.  Third, when you write by hand, your selection skills and your ability to select  important material improve. Why? Because you’re more   constrained   by  what you can actually write down. Writing by hand is harder, it takes more  time. You have to   slow down   and select only the most important pieces of  information, and you must do it in a concise way that captures the concept.  69   Pam A. Mueller and Daniel M. Oppenheimer, “The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard:  Advantages of Longhand Over Laptop Note Taking,” Psychological Science 25, no. 6  ( June 1, 2014): 1159–68.
204      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Fourth, when I wrote by hand in class, I was more present. This resulted  in two things: first, time flew by. And second, I enjoyed class much more  than I would have if my laptop had been open. In fact, research suggests that  those who write by hand end up experiencing much more joy than those  who type away at their keyboard. 70  Last, when you write by hand, you simply get better results.  In a college environment, one might assume it to be socially acceptable to  be perceived as   studious   or a   hard worker   by peers. Yet, this wasn’t always  the case. I’d often find myself faced with direct questions from my peers.  For instance, my friends would say to me, point-blank:   The lecture material  is posted on the class website. Why are you taking notes?   I found myself having  to answer this question more often than one would imagine.  I recall a fellow student bragging,   I don’t need to take notes.   He then pointed  to his head and said,   I keep everything in here .  In these situations I was faced with a choice.   Should I stick with taking notes  by hand, or should I try to appear smarter by holding it all in my head?   I decided  to press forward with my practice of taking notes by hand (even though it  was hard work and slow).  Thankfully I stuck to the hard way, because every single time, in every single  class, I outperformed my other classmates who didn’t take notes. I also out -  performed everyone who took notes by typing. Oh, and the guy claiming  to keep everything in his brain? He almost flunked out.

205 A NALOG     Something counterintuitive happened during the Renaissance among  learned scholars and thinkers. During this period, the typographic industry  exploded in growth (the so-called   ars artificialiter scribendi ). 71   Previous to  this, scholars relied on “helpers” and scribes to do their writing for them.  After the typographic machines came onto the scene, however, scholars read  texts via typographic medium by themselves. They also began to write their  own thoughts in commonplace books. Soon after, the scholars began parting  ways with their scribes and helpers. Instead of dictating their thoughts to  them, they “chose to handwrite.” 72   Why? Because writing by hand developed  their thoughts to a far greater degree than simply dictating their thoughts  to their helpers.  WRITING BY HAND ENABLES A COMMUNICATION  PARTNER TO EMERGE IN THE ANTINET  At the time of his death, Luhmann’s literary estate contained three thousand  of his manuscripts, two hundred of which were previously unpublished.  The starting point for these manuscripts was Luhmann’s Antinet, where he  developed the foundation through writing by hand.  Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying,  it is the   medium   of all this work. 73  Writing is not the pharmakon of memory; instead, it is  a hypomnematic device that encourages scholars to use  their mental energies for more abstract—that is, context-  detached operations. 74  71   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in  Early Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill,  2016), 24.  72   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in  Early Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill,  2016), 24.  73   Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing,  Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers (North  Charleston, SC: CreateSpace, 2017), 2.  74   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management   Evolution in
206      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Writing does not come   after   research. It is the very thing that develops the  research. Writing is the process by which you actually   understand   research.  And as the scientific literature shows, writing by hand promotes this under -  standing better than typing on a keyboard. 75   Sönke Ahrens points this out  as well: in terms of   understanding   what they had been taught, students who  write by hand outshine those who write by keyboard. 76  This illustrates an important point: developing your thoughts through  writing by hand builds the foundation for your thinking and is the starting  point from which thoughts can be developed into something even greater.  It is not the end itself. If someone believes that an Antinet alone spits  out great work, they’re dreaming. This seems to be the belief of digital  notetaking bubble graph boiz. For an Antinet to truly bear fruit, the initial  thought that is developed with the Antinet must continue to be processed  in manuscript form.  This seems to be less of a likelihood with digital tools. It’s all too easy to  copy-and-paste notes and then try developing them from there. When you  use an Antinet, there’s no other choice but to rewrite the knowledge from  your cards into your text editor (and thereby, you reprocess your already  processed thoughts). You’re essentially reprocessing the thoughts you’ve  already processed when you originally wrote them down by hand. This is  hugely advantageous and should not be overlooked.  Luhmann’s Antinet put his thoughts through an intense process so that,  by the time they were included in a manuscript or book, the thought was  developed to a far deeper degree than just thinking while typing.

He started with a “leg up” compared to the alternative of thinking on the  fly while writing a manuscript.  When writing a manuscript with your Antinet, you have your notecards to  guide you, and it begins to feel like a true partnership.  I’ve experienced this myself by writing this book. The notes from my Anti -  net have already gone through development in two ways: (1) short-term  development through writing by hand, and (2) long-term development  by way of engaging new, supporting evidence and further calcifications  of an idea (backed by more examples, reflections, reformulations and  excerpts).  When it comes down to typing the notes into a manuscript, it’s boring to  just type things word-for-word from your notes; instead, the experience  is a lot more active and fun if thinking is involved while typing and while  trying to fully decipher what is being said. You end up developing thoughts  to further clarity. Right now, I’m writing this paragraph you’re reading  right now with my notecards sitting to the left of my keyboard. Oftentimes,  I’ll find myself arguing with what I’ve written on the notecards and sometimes  phrase what I’ve written very differently. I question what I’ve written on the  notecards and feel compelled to re-check sources.   Did the author who I’m  quoting, really say that?!   I say to myself. I then check, and more often than  not, I find that the author did indeed say it.  This entire experience enables me to connect with the reader more and  communicate the idea properly by sharing with the reader my own initial  skepticisms when presented with an idea. For instance,   I know what you’re  about to read may sound suspect. I realize the concept of ‘communicating with a  ghost in a box of notecards’ sounds like woo-woo mysticism. Yet, this is precisely  how the greatest social scientist of the 20th century explained the Antinet.  In this respect, the Antinet becomes a true communication partner, a true  writing partner. At the foundation of such an emergent experience is the  technology of analog notes…written by hand.
208      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  WRITING BY HAND SPARKS AN EVOLUTIONARY  ADVANCE THAT DEVELOPS WORKING MEMORY  CAPACITY  The deliberate process of writing by hand, observes Harvard University  researcher Ann Blair, “produced a somewhat odd effect.” The system, which  was supposed to simply replace the cognitive overhead of having to mem -  orize information both, (1) replaced cognitive overhead of memorizing,  and unexpectedly, (2) it enhanced one’s ability to retain almost everything  learned Renaissance scholars had read. The handwritten notetaking system  and “the respective construction of a card index were considered both a  substitute for personal memory and a memory aid.” 77  What Blair describes is a   contradiction .   Contradictions , such as a method that  both   replaces the cognitive process of memorization and, at the same time,  enhances it, serves as a sign of a “transitional” phase towards progress in evo -  lution. 78   In effect, the practice of writing things down by hand, and thereby  building a thinking system that enhances one’s ability to retain information,  serves as an evolutionary jump for humans who possess this faculty. This  scholar observed the phenomenon of a thinking system (built of hand-writ -  ten notes and indexes) replacing and enhancing memory, and observed  that such a system “may be understood as signs of evolutionary advance.” 79  Central to evolutionary advances sits one key concept:   contradictory phenom -  ena . Therefore, it’s rather puzzling that the world of notetaking today finds  the majority of its practitioners opting for digital systems. These systems  have not proven themselves to possess the contradictory phenomenon of  analog systems. Indeed, science proves digital systems to be less effective  than analog systems for learning   and   understanding (which will be covered  shortly). Digital systems may serve as an adequate   memory replacement   tool;  however, they are not   memory enhancement   tools. Analog systems are both.  77   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016), 24.  78   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016), 24.  79   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016), 24.
209 A NALOG     The seemingly contradictory nature of being both a memory replacement  tool   and   a memory enhancement tool points to analog systems as the more  evolutionarily advanced   medium (as absurd as that may seem).  The practice of writing by hand, as pointed out by Ann Blair, results in the  enhancement of memory. This is of supreme importance because one of  the most critical elements involved in learning is the development of one’s  working memory capacity . 80  Let’s talk briefly about the science of human memory now.  Working Memory, Short-term Storage,  and Long-term Storage  Working memory   refers to the process in which information is stored in your  short-term memory, where it is actively worked on and encoded. After this  stage, memories can then be stored in long-term storage for later retrieval.  Luhmann wrote of   multiple storage   memory systems being around the corner,  yet the computing power of his era wasn’t able to produce such a thing. 81  However, we also know that Luhmann wasn’t convinced that computer  memory would replace the need for systems relying on human memory.  From Luhmann’s notecard we can see Luhmann was familiar with W. Ross  Ashby’s view that “our scientific thinking [of human memory] tends to be  grossly misled by the example of the big digital computer.” 82  80   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press,  2018), 7-8.  81   “ZK II: Note 9 / 8b2—Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed September 21, 2021,   https://  niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8b2_V ; “ZK II:  Zettel 9/8,2—Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,” accessed March 3, 2022,   https://niklas-luh -  mann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8-2_V ; Johannes Schmidt,  “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication Partner, Publication  Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

210      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  By referencing the concept of   multiple storage , Luhmann seems to be more  in-tune with how the concept worked in abstract models of human mem -  ory (rather than the abstractions of abstractions of human memory, which  computer science devised).  What Luhmann may have been alluding to was something one scientist in  human memory refers to as “the most influential computational model of  memory.” 83   The model referred to was proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin in  1968—during Luhmann’s prime theoretical working days—and was known  as   dual storage . 84  The conception of dual storage systems became popular in the 1970s because  of its analogy to computer systems that have separate short-term and long-  term storage components. 85   It does not seem coincidental that Luhmann  wrote of both in such a close proximity to one another. 86   In brief, he was  likely aware of the dual storage memory model.  Today the dual storage memory model is encompassed under the term  Search of Associative Memory , or   “SAM” . According to SAM, remembered  information is stored in two different types of “containers” within your  mind: (1) short-term storage (“STS”), and (2) long-term storage (“LTS”). 87  SHORT-TERM STORAGE (STS) AND THE ANTINET  Short-term storage is thought of as a “buffer.” In a computing context,  83   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory.

211 A NALOG     a buffer is a temporary memory-storage area where data is stored before  being processed and installed into long-term storage. 88  STS has limited capacity for the number of items it can store.  Think of it like writing a bullet point list of ideas on a card and then shortly  thereafter elaborating on each of those bullet point ideas on a dedicated card.  STS is the phase in which you write main notes. You write excerpts, refor -  mulations, or reflections from your readings or source material. It’s the RAM,  in computer terms. It’s the working memory, which is developed through  writing by hand.  LONG-TERM STORAGE (“LTS”) AND THE ANTINET  In a later chapter, I’ll be teaching you the core components of the Antinet. The  primary box in which knowledge is developed happens in something called  “the main box.” Think of long-term storage as the main box of your Antinet,  the area where your developed thoughts are then stored for the long term.  Memory scientists liken LTS to a variant of associative neuro network models,  yet LTS comprises the following features: (1) it stores associations   among  items, and (2) it stores associations   between   items and context.  The Antinet’s tree structure, with proximity-based associations built into its  protocol, as well as its context branches, are a perfect instantiation of LTS.  Both the architecture of short-term storage and long-term storage are per -  fectly represented in the Antinet—much more perfectly than a collection  of mere bubbles linked together in a digital graph ( cough , digital notetaking  apps,   cough ).  Let’s jump back to working memory.  88   Angus Stevenson and Christine A. Lindberg, eds., New Oxford Amerian Dictionary 3rd  Edition, 3rd edition (Oxford   ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), s.v. “Buffer.”
212      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Before information can be installed into long-term storage (the main box  of your Antinet), it must first be encoded and then processed. You encode  and process the thoughts by   writing by hand . 89  A popular factoid related to working memory is the idea that it can only hold  seven chunks of information in it. 90   However the latest research argues that  working memory can only hold four items during the processing phase. 91  When doing knowledge work, and when thinking, it’s advantageous to pos -  sess the ability to hold multiple ideas in your mind simultaneously. Often I’ll  create a card that states four or five   hypotheses . 92   Each individual one then  will get a dedicated card to be built out individually.  We find instances of Luhmann doing this as well. For instance, take the  following note from Luhmann’s archived Zettelkasten:  89   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 8.  90   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 7.  91   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 8.  92   Note how I use the term hypotheses instead of theses. A hypothesis is a proposed explana -  tion made on the basis of limited evidence. A thesis is a statement that is put forward as a  premise to be proved. When you’re developing your knowledge using an Antinet, you’re  putting forth an idea for further investigation (usually on limited evidence). For this rea -  son, it’s more fitting to refer to such as a hypothesis  photo credit :  “ZK I: Note 17,11e—  Niklas Luhmann  Archive,” accessed  March 23, 2022,  https://niklas-  luhmann-archiv.de/  bestand/zettelkasten/  zettel/ZK_1_  NB_17-11e_V.
213 A NALOG     Luhmann lists out five hypotheses to be further developed. Each has a  corresponding letter which represents the dedicated card on which the  individual hypothesis is to be explored.  The parent card housing the hypothesis possesses the card address 17,11e.  The other cards are explored according to the red letter accompanying them.  For instance, 17,11ea, 17,11eD, 17,11eB, 17,11eA, etc.  The graph view of the tree looks like this:  photo credit : “ZK I: Note 17,11e - Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed March 23, 2022,  https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_1_NB_17-11e_V.  Being able to hold a handful of hypotheses in your mind at the same time  (as opposed to to one or two) becomes advantageous. It is valuable to  exercise and build up your   working memory capacity   because it is critical in  developing truly insightful thoughts.
214      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  In addition, there is an important subcomponent within working mem -  ory called “executive control,” which factors into your ability to control  your   attention . 93  Writing by hand and working in an analog system generates “less distractions  and less competing demands,” compared with the digital environments  (where you’re blasted with notifications, for example). Even for those who  profess to have self-discipline, are faced with the reality that they’re just one  click away from lost time. Even for those who claim to wield total self-disci -  pline, with digital notetaking, you’re just one click away from lost time. And  as Benjamin Franklin pointed out, “Lost time is never found again.”  WRITING BY HAND DISENTANGLES THOUGHTS  Dawson Trotman’s statement that   thoughts disentangle themselves when they  pass through your fingertips   certainly rings true for me, and other authors  have expressed similar sentiments. For instance, clinical psychologist and  bestselling author, Jordan Peterson. Peterson writes his books by coming up  with a skeleton framework of his thesis. He places the “skeleton framework”  in a Microsoft Word document and creates a mental image of the framework,  which he refers to as a   memory palace . 94   Yet even with Peterson’s techniques,  he ran into difficulties while finishing his book   12 Rules for Life . What helped  Peterson during this time was a certain pen with a light affixed to it that  allowed him to write in the dark. The   Pen of Light   is how he referred to it.  Instead of slogging away at his keyboard, he decided to write by hand. He  underwent the act of disentangling his thoughts by getting them out on paper  with a pen, enabling him to “find the words to properly close [the] book.” 95  WRITING BY HAND EXERCISES  NEURO-ASSOCIATIVE RECALL  In your quest to create genius-level work, you must exercise   neuro-associative  93   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 9.  94   “Jordan Peterson Reveals His Thought Process and Writing Techniques –YouTube,”  accessed February 25, 2022, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKc4-iVJsL0.  95   Jordan B.

I refer to this as   neuro-associative recall , and I hold that the Antinet develops  this ability much more than digital systems do.  For instance, I’ve employed the neuroimprinting process of writing by hand  and creating dedicated keyterms in my index for certain ideas, which has  resulted in my being able to instantly recall a concept or set of thoughts.  For instance, when presented with the concept of   power law , or the   pareto  principle   or the   80/20 principle , I instantly think of the keyterm   big impact .  The phrase   big impact   comes from a principle outlined by Nassim Nicholas  Taleb in   The Black Swan . He discusses the tradeoff between the   big picture  of things and   micro theory . That is, the   big events   vs.   micro events . He advises  one to focus on the   big picture   items that have a   big impact . 97  I’ve stamped this concept into my mind so that whenever I read something  new, I can instantly recall the thought. I know where in my Antinet to place  such similar thoughts that I come across while reading. This involves a strong  neuro-associative recall ability.  Neuro-associative recall involves the process of (1) consuming information  and inputs, and (2)   recalling   a concept   associated   with the new information.  This simple two-part process allows one to   compare   new information with  previous information to   learn   from and   recognize   surprising realizations.  Thus, it enables the Antinet to truly turn into a surprise-generator (one of  its core functions).  Let’s hone in on the second component of this process: “recall.”  96   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory. (New York: Oxford University  Press, 2014), 112. Kahana points out that the technical term is “associative recall.”  97   Nassim Nicholas Taleb, The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable, 2nd  ed., Random trade pbk. ed (New York: Random House Trade Paperbacks, 2010), 142ff.
216      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Memory researchers, when analyzing the critical process between an item’s  concept and a thought moving from short-term storage (such as in devel -  oping thoughts on main notes) to long-term storage (such as installing  the cards into your main box) demonstrate that the manner in which you  encode   a concept turns out to have a   substantial impact on recall . 98   In other  words, speaking thoughts into a voice recorder, as opposed to typing them  out or writing them out by hand, has a drastically different result for how  well you’ll recall that item. Not only this, it has a drastically different result  for how well you will   think through   the ideas in the first place.  Scientists specializing in human memory have identified two mechanisms  for encoding thoughts. These items have an impact on your ability to later  recall the thoughts. I go into these concepts in more detail elsewhere in the  book, but suffice it to say that these concepts are maintenance rehearsal  (refreshing on the notecards by reviewing them), and elaborative rehearsal  (thinking through the thoughts by writing them out by hand).  Encompassing both of these mechanisms that increase the strength of  recall is the following observation: recall critically depends on the amount  of   time   an item has spent being processed in short-term storage. 99   In other  words, the more time you spend processing ideas (as is involved in writing  by hand compared to typing digitally), the greater your ability to recall the  thought or concept later on.  If you still aren’t convinced in the power of writing by hand, I would like  to turn to two resources right now who will back me in this: (1) Science,  and (2) God.  HOW RESEARCH SUPPORTS WRITING BY HAND  There have been numerous studies outlining the benefits and power of  writing by hand. Let’s go through them now:  98   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory. (New York: Oxford  University Press, 2014), 246.  99   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory.

217 A NALOG     One group of researchers conducted an experiment that tested subjects’  ability to recognize characters. One segment of subjects copied down the  characters by hand; the other segment typed the characters on a keyboard.  Results showed that when the characters had been learned  by typing, they were more frequently confused with their  mirror images than when they had been written by hand.  This handwriting advantage did not appear immediately, but  mostly [appeared] three weeks after the end of the training. 100  In another study, a group of researchers studied the process of learning new  words. They compared three groups of people: those who wrote by hand  with pen, those wrote by hand with a digital pen, and those who typed on  a keyboard.  Some interesting results emerged from this study. First, “positive mood during  learning was significantly higher during handwriting than during typing.” 101  Second, the researchers found that “movements involved in handwriting  allow a greater memorization of new words.” 102  Last, “handwriting with a digital pen and tablet can increase the ability to  learn compared with keyboard typing once the individuals are accustomed  to it.” 103   This last finding may prompt one to consider using a digital pen  100   Marieke Longcamp et al., “Remembering the Orientation of Newly Learned Characters  Depends on the Associated Writing Knowledge: A Comparison between Handwriting  and Typing,” Human Movement Science, Advances in Graphonomics: Studies on Fine  Motor Control, Its Development and Disorders, 25, no. 4 (October 1, 2006): 646–56.  101   Aya S.

That is, laying out the cards in front of you,  considering the external context associated with sifting through your cards,  and the other benefits outlined in this book. Regardless, let’s call a spade a  spade: even digital handwriting outshines typing in terms of learning new  concepts, words, and stamping such information on your mind.  Another study by a group of researchers compared the memory process for  subjects who wrote by hand vs. typed. Here’s what they found:  A comparison of recall and recognition for common words  demonstrates that memory is better for words when they  have been written down rather than when they are typed.  This provides additional support for the hypothesis that the  additional context provided by the complex task of writing  results in better memory. With the recent trend towards  electronic note taking, the educational and practical impli -  cations of these findings would suggest that performance  may be improved by using traditional paper-and-pen notes. 104  Another researcher went deeper in exploring how handwriting seems to  positively impact the recognition process of memory. Here’s what she found:  My colleagues and I showed that early handwriting prac -  tice affects visual symbol recognition because it results  in the production of variable visual forms that aid in  symbol understanding. 105  One of the more popular studies on handwriting vs. typing using a keyboard  is titled,   The Pen Is Mightier than the Keyboard: Advantages of Longhand over  104   Timothy J.

219 A NALOG     Laptop Note Taking . Sönke Ahrens himself cites this research paper in his  book   How to Take Smart Notes ; yet puzzlingly enough, he seems to discard  such findings and explains to his readers that he opts for a digital Zettelkas -  ten due to   mobility . I won’t get into my gripe with this right now. Let’s talk  about the study itself.  The researchers, Pam A. Mueller and Daniel M. Oppenheimer conducted  a study involving two groups of students. One group took notes using a  laptop; the other group of students took notes by hand.  What the researchers discovered was that taking notes digitally may be  “impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing.” 106  Here is what the researchers discovered:  In three studies, we found that students who took notes  on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than  students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas  taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers’ ten -  dency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing  information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental  to learning. 107  While this study from 2014 supports my thesis that writing by hand is more  effective than writing digitally, I must share the latest research, which dis -  credits this finding (for sake of intellectual integrity). This brings us to a 2021  study titled,   Don’t Ditch the Laptop Just Yet: A Direct Replication of Mueller  and Oppenheimer’s (2014) Study 1 Plus Mini Meta-Analyses Across Similar  Studies . In this study, researchers replicated Mueller and Oppenheimer’s  106   Pam A. Mueller and Daniel M.

However, the results did not “support the idea that longhand note  taking improves immediate learning via better encoding of information.” 108  So, what do we make of this? Which one is mightier: pen or keyboard?  On this matter, I will say this: the only right answer is test. Experiment for  yourself. For many, the pen is indeed mightier than the keyboard; however,  the popularity and cultural stigma of using pen and paper prevents many  from adopting longhand. There’s an underlying pressure to use digital tools.  There’s an implicit sense that in order to “be smart” (and technically sophis -  ticated), one must embrace the supposed superpower of digital notetaking  apps (with their illusive bubble graphs). I think this is incorrect. Many  people use digital tools for thinking when, in reality, they should be using  analog tools. The most recent research appears to support this conclusion.  In a study titled,   Make a Note of It: Comparison in Longhand, Keyboard, and  Stylus notetaking Techniques , researchers found that “students performed  better using their preferred note-taking method.” 109   The moral of the story?  Experiment for yourself. Determine your preferred notetaking method (and  don’t be surprised to find that it is, indeed, writing by hand)!  Before we conclude this section, let’s briefly turn to a different practice:  reading. Not only has writing on a digital device been shown to hamper  learning and comprehension, a recent study found that even   reading com -  prehension   is reduced when using a digital device. 110   Even if you hold that  writing digitally is better for you, that doesn’t mean reading digitally is better  for you. In fact, reading digitally is probably   not   better for you (at least in  terms of comprehension).  108   Heather L.

HOW GOD SUPPORTS WRITING BY HAND  If you won’t take my word for it, and if you don’t care about the scientific  literature supporting the process of writing by hand, well, then I suppose  you can take the word of another entity. He goes by the name of… GOD !  For the LORD said, “Write the vision; make it plain on tablets” (Habakkuk  2:2 [NRSV]), or Isaiah 8:1 (NRSV): “Then the LORD said to me, take a  large tablet and write on it in common characters.”  There you have it. God espouses the power of writing by hand.  I lay forth this reason slightly tongue-in-cheek. I’d prefer you adopt the  practice of writing by hand by testing it out yourself (or from reading the  scientific literature). After all, I may have ever-so-slightly taken these quotes  from God out of context. But since these two verses were presented to me  while attending church with my family one day, I figured I might as well  extract them onto a bibcard and share them with you here.  CONCLUSION  There you have it. I’ve laid out in detail the power of analog, the power of  writing by hand, the people who write by hand, and the science behind  analog. Heck, I’ve even thrown in God as a reason to take writing by hand  seriously. If you’re still not convinced by the power of analog, well then, that  means only one thing: even God can’t help you. I’m kidding, of course, but  seriously: try the Antinet yourself. Only after that should you determine if  it’s truly as powerful as what I (and others) say.
222  C H A PT E R S E V E N  �  NUMERIC-ALPHA  “ Since all notes have fixed numbers, you can add as many references to them as  you may want. Central concepts can have many links which show on which other  contexts we can find materials relevant for them. Through references, we can,  without too much work or paper, solve the problem of multiple storage. ”  —Niklas Luhmann,   Communication with Noteboxes 1  NUMERIC-ALPHA ADDRESSES ARE  ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT  COMPONENT OF THE ANTINET  A lberto cevolini, a scholar   who   has studied a vast amount of knowl -  edge systems throughout history, observes that Luhmann’s numbering  of entries is too important to brush over too quickly. In the scholar’s view,  Luhmann’s numeric-alpha scheme represents one of the most interesting  evolutionary transitions in the field of knowledge management systems. 2  The most important feature of the Antinet is the one that generates its most  important results. To Luhmann the most important result of the Antinet  concerns its   inner life .  1   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

223 N UMERIC -A LPHA     The inner life of the Antinet is brought about by two things.  First, it revolves around creating a   communication partner   (a second mind,  a   ghost in the box , and an alter-ego).  In the beginning of his paper on his Antinet, Luhmann states something  rather radical: he says that “it is easy to think of systems theory” as the way  to describe the Antinet. After all, “we consider ourselves to be systems.” But  he goes on to explain that he chooses “communication theory” to describe  his system. “One of us listens to the other.” He continues, “This needs to  be explained.” 3  The radical notion centers on his usage of the terms   us   and   we . What he’s  referring to is the communication and dialogue that takes place between him  and his Antinet, yet the way in which he’s referring to it makes him sound  more like a schizophrenic than the most important German sociologist of  the twentieth century!  But if we decide to take Luhmann’s word for it, perhaps we could learn  something from this. Perhaps there really is something to the idea of creating  a communication partner out of an analog notebox.  How do we go about experiencing such a phenomenon of creating a com -  munication partner?  According to Luhmann, it requires giving each card a   firm fixed place   through  use of a numeric-alpha address. “This decision about structure…” according  to Luhmann, “makes possible the creation of high complexity in the card file  and   thus makes possible its ability to communicate in the first place .” 4  3   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

224      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The second component of the inner life of the Antinet is its ability to become  a   surprise-generator   through its ability to produce fortunate   accidents . “The  role of accidents in the theory of science is not disputed,” writes Luhmann.  “If you employ evolutionary models, accidents assume a most important role.” 5  These   accidents   are really   accidental insights   that come about by stumbling  upon ideas or thoughts while exploring the physical form and nature of your  knowledge (by sifting through your cards by hand).  These two components describe the most important aspect of Luhmann’s  system, its “inner life.” As Luhmann writes:  For the inner life of the card index, for the arrangement  of notes or its mental history, it is most important that  we decide against the systematic ordering in accordance  with topics and sub-topics and choose instead a firm fixed  place (Stellordnung). 6  The most important component for establishing the   inner life   of this system, and  giving it a   firm fixed place , revolves around one thing: numeric-alpha addresses.  This makes it quite puzzling when so-called Zettelkasten experts, productiv -  ity experts, PKM experts, and second-brain proselytizers take a nonchalant  approach to explaining numeric-alpha addresses.  THE HISTORY OF NUMERIC-ALPHA  ADDRESSES IN NOTECARD SYSTEMS  Niklas Luhmann was not the first person to devise the notion of using numer -  ic-alpha addresses on notecards. Fridericus Sidelius and Paulus Sigismundus  recommended notecards ( excerpta schedacea ) in a booklet they published  in 1713. In the booklet they stated “it would be sufficient to preserve index  cards in distinguished files and number them consecutively, while leaving  5   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

Harrison’s system was called the “Ark of Studies.” Harrison  advised that the notecard-like slips of paper in the Ark of Studies could be  arranged in alphabetical order, or, could be numbered. 8  At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Johann Benedict Metzler recom -  mended numbering notecards because “compared with alphabetical order,  numerical order is clearer and avoids the inconvenience of empty spaces.” 9  The history of numeric-alpha notes stands quite rich. Many thinkers stumbled  onto the system because it simply makes sense. John Locke even devised his  own numeric-alpha system for his notes. 10   In Antonin Sertillanges’s Antinet,  which he outlines in his 1921 book,   The Intellectual Life , he advises that each  slip should be numbered in the corner or in the middle of the slip. 11  Luhmann never shared specifically where he got the idea for his Antinet.  Nor did he state where the idea for using numeric-alpha addresses came  from. However, I believe much of the system’s essence derived from the  first job he held during his short legal career. The first job he took after law  school was at the Lüneburg Higher Administrative Court. His task was to  organize a reference system for administrative court decisions. According  to Luhmann, “the court should be able to see what higher court decisions  7   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 27.  8   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 28.  9   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 28.  10   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016), 28.  11   OP A.

He worked at the Lüneburg Higher Administrative Court precisely around  the time he created his first Zettelkasten system (1952–1953).  Recently, a group of researchers gathered on Luhmann’s ninetieth birthday  to discuss Luhmann’s time at the Lüneburg Higher Administrative Court.  Of Luhmann’s work during that time, one scholar noted that there are no  longer any physical traces; all traces of it were destroyed in accordance with  regulations. 13   However, from personnel notes about Luhmann at the time,  we learn several things, including that Luhmann built out a notebox in the  court’s library.  The scheme used in the German legal administration system relies on  each document having a “file number” ( Aktenzeichen ). 14   This number is,  separated by a slash (/), is unique (no file can have the same number), and  can be combined with alphabetical characters. An example   Aktenzeichen  is 211321/37 a.  In brief, Luhmann’s work at Lüneburg Higher Administrative Court greatly  shaped the origins of the numeric-alpha address. If Luhmann didn’t learn  about   Aktenzeichen   at the Lüneburg Higher Administrative Court, then  at the very least, it derived from his time studying law and using such a  reference system.  THE ANATOMY OF NUMERIC-ALPHA  ADDRESSES  The anatomy of numeric-alpha addresses is quite simple. Each address starts  with a number and can be combined with an alphabetical character that  serves as a   variant   of the idea. From there, the addresses “branch-down,” and  12   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 11.  13   Timon Beyes et al., eds., Niklas Luhmann am OVG Lüneburg: zur Entstehung der  Systemtheorie, Soziologische Schriften, Band 86 (Berlin: Duncker & Humblot, 2021), 15.  14   “Aktenzeichen (Deutschland),” in Wikipedia, February 3, 2022, https://de.wikipedia.  org/w/index.php?title=Aktenzeichen(Deutschland)&oldid=219821207.

Personally, I prefer forward slashes ( / ).  Let’s use a hypothetical example. Here is an example of an arbitrary set  of branches:  –   3000 –Natural Science  *   3100 –Biology  *   3110 –Zoology  *   3118 –Specific Animals of Interest  *   3118/1 –Horses  *   3118/2 –Donkeys  *   3118/3 –Turtles (I like turtles)  Now, let’s say later on you want to add a card for a mule (the offspring of a  male donkey and a female horse).  You’re faced with a few options. In fact, you can really do anything (as long  as you link to the   Mule   card). However let’s say you wish to place the   Mule  card after   Donkey   and before   Turtles . What do you do? It’s simple. You create  a card 3118/2 a   for   Mules .  It then looks like this:  –   3118/1 –Horses  –   3118/2 –Donkeys  –   3118/2A –Mules  –   3118/3 –Turtles  The 3118/2 a   is the numeric-alpha address for mules. It never changes.  As Luhmann writes, it has a   fixed position , which is a core element that  gives your Antinet its inner life. It’s such a simple discipline and practice  yet, over time, you’ll see that this simple concept turns your Antinet into a  communication partner   and a brilliant system for generating breakthroughs  (by way of   accidents ).
228      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  NUMERIC-ALPHA ADDRESSES  IN REAL LIFE  When you start looking for them, you’ll start to see numeric-alpha addresses  everywhere; for instance, freeway exit numbers.  Numeric-alpha addresses in the Antinet operate much like the addresses  allotted to freeway exits. Instead of having to remember full names, one can  simply look for a numeric-alpha address like 9 b . The 9 b   simply routes you  to a location. It does not indicate a hierarchical relationship with exits 9 or  9 a ; it just indicates that the exit will take you to a different location in the  world. This is precisely how such addresses work in the Antinet; they route  you to different locations in your tree of knowledge.
229 N UMERIC -A LPHA     NUMERIC-ALPHA ADDRESSES UNLOCK  THE SELF-REFERENTIAL NATURE OF  THE ANTINET  The concept of   self-reference   refers to the notion of a sentence, idea, formula,  function, or a system that refers to its   self   (or itself). For instance, the term  “I” in English is a self-reference to oneself. Or take the concept def init(self):  in the Python programming language used in computing). It enables a class to  create objects that refer to itself and that   call   itself (reference itself). Self-ref -  erential statements are often paradoxical and can be considered   recursive .  The scholar Alberto Cevolini observes that an numeric-alpha address “ensures  utmost autonomy, i.e.   self-referential closure of the machine .” 15  The   self-referential closure of the machine   is a critical piece of the Antinet’s  architecture. It’s the key piece that transforms the Antinet into a   cybernetic  system   (a system that achieves a goal through feedback and communication).  The numeric-alpha addresses enable the Antinet to refer to itself and its  own individual parts. It’s a key piece for creating the   personality   (the   ghost ,  the   alter ego ). As a result, observes Cevolini, “interaction” with the Antinet,  becomes “a type of communication”—an internal dialogue. 16  Luhmann was intimately familiar with the power of self-referential systems.  His magnum opus social theory was largely predicated on society as a  self-referential system. 17   As such, Luhmann designed the Antinet with the  capability to refer to itself. Just as a human can refer to its own parts (like  the left hand), the Antinet can refer to its own parts (its thoughts identified  by its unique numeric-alpha card addresses).  15   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016),  28.

230      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Luhmann was also greatly influenced by the idea of   self-description . He was  inspired by the work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, a German phi -  losopher who wrote extensively about self-description by way of making  the case for philosophy as the apotheosis of science. 18   Luhmann’s theories  attempted to adhere to the idea of self-description. He sought to devise a  theory of society that explained itself through itself. 19  For a fun illustration of self-referential systems, let’s take an example from  my own Antinet. I have a card at the very beginning (card address 0).  My own Antinet essentially introduces himself and refers to his own parts.  This may seem absurd, but Luhmann did similar things in his own Antinet. 20  It keeps things light and fun!  18   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press, 2011), 35.  19   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press, 2011), 37.  20“ZK II: Zettel 9/8j—Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,” accessed February 22, 2022,   https://  niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8j_V .
231 N UMERIC -A LPHA     THE SCIENCE BEHIND NUMERIC-ALPHA  ADDRESSES  Throughout this book I emphasize over and over that Luhmann’s system was  a deliberate creation. It mirrors how human memory works to a surprisingly  close degree.  The numeric-alpha addresses transform the Antinet’s network into something  akin to   auto-associations   discussed in memory science. An auto-association  is built on   content-addressable memory , similar to how computes work: “the  bits themselves are meaningless, and the bytes made out of them have  arbitrary addresses, like houses on a street, which have nothing to do with  their contents.” 21  This is also how the Antinet works thanks to the numeric-alpha addresses.  “Memory locations are accessed by their addresses.” 22   The way in which you  explore these addresses is through the keyterms which are housed in the  index, serving as a cue to light up areas of your mind.  Multi-storage models posited by those who study human memory indicate  why numeric-alpha addresses are critical. Johannes Schmidt explains that,  “embedding a topic in various   contexts   gives rise to different lines of informa -  tion by means of opening up different realms of   comparison   in each case.” 23  THE CONCEPT OF COMPARISON  Let’s talk about the concept of   comparison   briefly. Steven Pinker points out  an important point relating to the concept of   comparison   in his book   How  the Mind Works . Pinker writes that without specifying a goal, “the very idea  of intelligence is meaningless.” 24  21   Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works, Norton pbk (New York: Norton, 2009), 104.  22   Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works, Norton pbk (New York: Norton, 2009), 104.  23   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

232      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  And what is   intelligence ? It’s something that comes from   information , thus  bringing up the question,   What is information?   According to Pinker, “infor -  mation is a correlation between two things that is produced by a lawful  process.” 25   For instance, the rings of a tree stump   compared   with the age of  the tree. The Antinet is constructed around this concept. Before you install  anything into the Antinet, it   forces   comparison and correlation. As Luhmann  puts it, “Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which possess a  comparative schema—even if this amounts only to: ‘this or something else.’” 26  THE CONCEPT OF RELATIONS  “ Life is just one damn relatedness after another .”  —Julian Huxley 27  When you install anything in the Antinet, you’re   relating   the concept on the  note to the   most similar   concept already installed in your Antinet. You’re  comparing, contrasting, and correlating the thought with all other thoughts  in long-term storage.  This introduces us to the concept that the Antinet is really a relation of  “(selective) relations,” as Johannes Schmidt puts it. 28   For instance, when you  read, there’s a relation between the book and your mind. 29   These are what  one would call   selective relations . You’re selecting information from a book  that you relate to another thought in your mind. From here, you   relate   this  information to other thoughts already installed in your Antinet.

However, with   remotelinks , which will be detailed later, we can link to other  relations of selective relations   on other branches of our Antinet.  In effect, we have a   relation of relations of selective relations . Basically, the  Antinet is a spider-like web of knowledge you’ve selected from your readings.  If you find this a bit confusing, don’t worry. You’re not the only one. I’ll  explain it in a clearer manner later in this book—specifically, in the chapter  on   selection .  In brief, the Antinet and its numeric-alpha address scheme models itself after  the science of human memory. Creating a note in a stream of consciousness  state mirrors the   short-term storage   concept in human memory. In turn, this  opens up different realms of information when the card is installed in your  Antinet (the   long-term storage   component of human memory). The different  realms of information are powered by the core process built into the Antinet:  comparing thoughts and deciding what they’re   related   to ( this or something  else , as Luhmann says). 30  THE RESISTANCE OF NUMERIC-ALPHA  ADDRESSES  For some reason, numeric-alpha addresses never took off within the land of  digital Zettelkasten. Why? Probably because it was perceived as unnecessary. 31  I’ve brought up Johannes Schmidt’s statement that numeric-alpha addresses  serve as   an essential prerequisite for creativity   in Luhmann’s system. 32   Yet  30   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans. Manfred  Kuehn, https://daily.scottscheper.com/zettelkasten/.  31   In reality, the only thing unnecessary in digital Zettelkasten is the ‘digital’ part!  32   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication
234      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  I’m met with resistance to this assertion. Some object that my reasoning  is “an appeal to authority and not a proper argument.” 33   This objection is  puzzling because the entire premise of using a Zettelkasten in the first place  comes from an appeal to authority. 34   Regardless, there’s not much that can  be accomplished through theoretical debate on this front. In reality, one  must investigate the power of numeric-alpha addresses for oneself. This is  only achieved through experimenting with the system and experiencing  it first-hand.  With that said, I’d like to caution against the common convention used in  digital Zettelkasten systems today:   human-readable note titles . For instance,  in writing a note on the definition of self-reference, many digital Zettelkasten  practitioners would name the note or filename Definition of Self-reference,  or Self-reference (Definition), or some other scheme. However, in an Antinet,  the note would receive a numeric-alpha address like 4214/1A/0.  Here’s why this is important:  A numeric-alpha card address instantiates a   thought . A thought is an incommu -  nicable event that takes place in the mind. You can do your best to represent  a thought by communicating it as clearly as possible; however, you cannot  “losslessly” export that thought and perfectly install it in the mind of the receiver.  As such, a thought is encompassed by many things, including words, images,  and other elements of reality. Giving it a numeric-alpha address is a way  of treating it properly.

This is why giving the thought a numeric-alpha address is preferred.  The thought   is   the thought. It is not, and should not, be watered down by  artificial phrases (aka, a note title).  In human memory, a thought is a collection of many things; and it’s  melded together with links.

THE TWO CLASSES OF LINKS  There are two classes of links in an Antinet:  1.   Internal Links  2.   External Links  You can think of it like this:   internal links   refer to links within your own mind  (i.e., within the Antinet).   External links   refer to links to another’s mind (i.e.,  external to your Antinet).  35   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

236      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  I. Internal Links  An   internal link   is a link to an area or card in your Antinet. There are several  types of internal links:  1. MAINCARD LINKS (AKA, “CARDLINKS”)  The majority of internal links in your Antinet are   maincard links   (aka,   card -  links ). These are links to cards in the main box of your Antinet. Such links  look like 5425/2 a , 1337/1 b , etc.  There are several types of cardlinks: (1) Stemlinks, (2) Branchlinks, and (3)  Remotelinks. We’ll briefly cover these now.  i. stemlinks  Stemlinks are links that are relative to the current stem of thought that  you’re on. For instance, say the current card you’re on is 4214/2 e /3 a . If you  see a link on the card that simply reads /1, this tells you the link is to card  4214/2 e /3 a /1. The /1 is a stemlink.  Stemlinks are similar to the concept   relative links   within the world of web  development. Luhmann employed this concept in his own Antinet, which  Johannes Schmidt refers as “single references.” 36  For instance, on the card 17.1b9, you’ll see the red numbers 1 and 2.  36   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

237 N UMERIC -A LPHA     The red 1 and 2 are stemlinks. They are links to the cards 17.1b9.1 and 17.1b9.2.  This is helpful when you’re writing in a stream of consciousness manner. It  sends a signal in the form of a reminder that you intend to elaborate on certain  sentences by giving them a dedicated card in the following stem of thought.  ii. branchlinks  Branchlinks are a concept I started using for the sake of saving space. For  instance, say I’m writing a note on the card 5218/2 a . If I want to link to  another card, say 5218/1/1 a /2 b /1, instead of writing out the 5218, I’ll use  the tilde character (~). In computing, the tilde character typically refers to  the current user’s home directory. Within the world of the Antinet, it refers  to the current card’s branch. Therefore, instead of writing 5218/1/1 a /2 b /1,  I write ~/1/1 a /2 b /1, which is a link within the current branch I’m in (5218).  The ~/1/1 a /2 b /1 is a branchlink, which is shorthand for 5218/1/1 a /2 b /1.  iii. remotelinks  Say you’re writing a note within the card 4214/5 a /2 and you create a link  to the card 1334/2 a /4. What you have just created is a   remotelink . You’re  linking to a card in a remote area in your tree of knowledge. Remotelinks  are essentially the full card address of another card that resides in a relatively  remote part of your Antinet.  Think of remotelinks kind of like vines on a tree. A vine will take you from  one branch of a tree, to a more remote branch of the tree.  the science of maincard links  Given that Luhmann was deliberate in the design of the Antinet’s structure,  we can begin to see the brilliance in how it mirrors the way human memory  works. 37   In the field of memory science, stemlinks are what are called   forward  37   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution  in Early Modern Europe 53 (2016), 300. As covered in this book, Luhmann was not forced  into the Antinet’s architecture. There were other options at his disposal. He could have  chosen a commonplace book structure, or a categorically-organized notecard system.  As Schmidt says, “At first glance, Luhmann’s organization of his collection appears to lack
238      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  and backward associations . 38   The branchlinks are items located nearby, and in  one’s general neighborhood. Yet, like human memory, the further away and  the more items there are in between each memory, the association decreas -  es. 39   Remotelinks mimic “remote associations” as understood in the study of  human memory. 40   Again, the further away the memories are from one another,  the further their association is (unless they’re connected via remotelinks).  when in doubt, use full cardlinks  Both stemlinks and branchlinks are shorthand and can save time. When in  doubt, the safest bet is to write the full card address. Regardless, it’s nice to  have stemlinks and branchlinks at your disposal when creating notes.  2. KEYTERM LINKS  Keyterm links are links that point you to a keyterm in the index box. For  instance, on some of my notes I’ll have a keyterm written and underlined in  green or blue ink. This tells me to refer to the index and look up that term.  For instance, here’s a collective of links for the section I’m writing about  right now (on the concept of links).  any clear order; it even seems chaotic.

For instance, here’s the keyterm for Association found in my index box:  From here, I can then add any sections related to this section on   Links   as I see fit.  II. External Links (aka, ExRefs)  External links (aka, ExRefs) are external references to an outside source of  knowledge (like a book, YouTube video, podcast, etc.). Also included in the  external link is the page number (or timestamp) from the source.  My ExRefs are always written in red pen, and they resemble that of a footnote.  There are two formats of an ExRef. They either begin with a b. or an r.. We’ll  cover both types of ExRefs now.  1. BIBLIOGRAPHY BOX EXREFS  The Antinet’s bibliography box is an analog reference manager. It enables  one to organize and manage their bibliography references using “bibcards.”  More on bibcards will be covered later. Basically, they’re cards that contain  the details of the book you engage with (or podcast, video, website, etc.).
240      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The first type of ExRef begins with a lowercase-b, followed by a period (b.).  Here’s an example from the card 4214/4/1 bd /1.

It signals that the  idea originated from the bibcard, b.NakladovaJohann, and from the page  number 199. Think of the b.NakladovaJohann kind of like a   tag   (in digital  speak). It’s a short phrase that enables one to quickly navigate to the reference  in the bib box. If we look up b.NakladovaJohann in the bib box, we find the  full details of this reference:

DIGITAL REFERENCE MANAGER EXREFS  When people talk about a   reference manager , they really mean a   digital  reference manager . This is a digital tool for storing bibliographic references.  These encompass books, articles, papers, videos, podcasts, or other media.  While I am a major proponent of using the analog medium as a thinking  system, I am not a luddite. There are clear advantages in using a digital ref -  erence manager, as well. First, digital reference managers allow you to store  local copies of web pages. This ensures that you’ll have the source even if  the web page is later deleted. And second, digital reference managers are  convenient in that they automatically format references in whatever style  guide you use (AP Style, Chicago Style, MLA Style, etc.).  There are a number of digital apps to choose from when it comes to a refer -  ence manager. I’ve tried a handful of them, yet the one I always go back to  is called   Zotero . 41   It’s simple, it’s free and it has all the features you’ll need.  There are cases in which I’ll read a web page that is brief enough that it’s  unnecessary to create a dedicated hand-written bibcard for it. Yet, at the  same time, there will be ideas in it that I’ll want to reference in a maincard.  In such instances, I first add the article to Zotero using a one-click browser  extension. Then, I create a   tag   for the referenced article that begins with a  lowercase-r, followed by a period (r.). Unlike the b., the r. tells me the item  is stored in my   digital   reference manager.  Here’s an example of a digital reference manager ExRef from my own Antinet:  41   https://www.zotero.org/
242      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The r.Zetteldan.1 tells me to look this tag up in Zotero. When I do this, I’m  pointed to a blog post about the Zettelkasten written by a software developer  named Daniel Lüdecke. 42   The r.Zetteldan.1 is an ExRef stored in Zotero. Such  ExRefs are quite useful. Digital reference manager ExRefs are yet another  tool you have at your disposal.  Now that you know the fundamentals of links in the Antinet, let’s jump back  into the land of theory. We’ll cap this chapter off by discussing the real-life  memory science of links.  The Science and Importance of Links  “ Each note is only an element that derives its quality from the web  of references and cross references within the system. A note that  is not linked to this web becomes lost in the file; the file forgets it. ”  —Niklas Luhmann 43  42   “Luhmanns Arbeitsweise Im Elektronischen Zettelkasten,” Strenge Jacke!

Two items are said to be associated if presentation of one leads  to thinking of (or responding with) the other. ”  —Michael J. Kahana,   Foundations of Human Memory 44  In memory-science terminology, links are   associations . When trying to  think of a memory, you’re undergoing something called the process of  retrieval . The most widely accepted theories of how retrieval works revolve  around   association . 45  Association is the raw material powering two things: (1) biological learning,  and (2) artificial learning (specifically, deep learning). 46  The manner in which associations are built within digital notetaking apps  look nice and pretty. They create nifty-looking graphs and visualizations.  However, such tools are not structured in a way to optimize   learning . Antinets,  on the other hand, are built entirely around association. You cannot install  a note in the Antinet without associating it with the neighboring notes. As  a result a chain-reaction takes place in the system. All notes are essentially  chain-linked to every other note in the system. This is the concept of   asso -  ciative chaining , which I detail later in this book.

Their name and structure are inspired by the human  brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another.”
244      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  It seems like a rather fringe area of focus, yet the study of   how association occurs  in the brain   ended up revolutionizing the world. This field of study sparked  the discovery of neural networks in the 1970s. 47   Artificial neural networks  sit at the heart of deep learning, which is a subfield of machine learning. 48  If you use Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Google, Amazon, Netflix—and  really almost any large-scale consumer internet product—there’s a high  probability you’re interacting with an artificial neural network. 49   Even if  you’re in a car, there’s a chance you’re interacting with a neural network. 50  All of these technologies are powered by the science that emerged from  the question of how linking works in the human brain. This is why I’m  bothering to spend time emphasizing the power and importance of links  and associations!  To recap, the raw material of deep learning is a neural network, and the raw  material of neural networks are the thing the Antinet is built on:   associations .  If you’re aiming to build a knowledge development system that increases  learning and unconventional insights, then it’s important to understand  how associations work (and how they’re structured within the Antinet).  The human memory operates with concepts analogous to the types of asso -  ciations in the Antinet (stemlinks, branchlinks, and remotelinks). Digital  notetaking apps are not structured in such a way. The digital notetaking  preachers seem to treat such a structure as a matter of personal preference  which, I hold, is a grave mistake. 51  47   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory.

245 N UMERIC -A LPHA     Even though digital notetaking preachers get a lot of things wrong, they  do get some things correct. One author gets it correct by emphasizing the  importance of   association   in an abstracted information network, yet he still  under-represents the depth of its importance. 52  You see, associations in a neural network are not   opt-in . They’re not just a  clever strategy. They’re not some hip, new workflow method. They’re not  a   best-practice   one ought to follow for good knowledge work.   Associations  are not optional in an Antinet , they are a   requirement . Like a neural network,  associations are a requirement in an Antinet. Before you can install anything  into your Antinet, it must be associated with, and installed near, its most  related note.  The association composition in an Antinet is not one of mere opinion.  It ought to mirror the two properties related to how   long-term storage   in  human memory works. The Antinet stores associations among items, and  it stores associations   between   items and context.  The Antinet’s tree structure, with proximity-based associations as well as  context-based associations (in terms of stems and branches), serves as a  perfect model for how human memory works. It’s the model the Antinet  is built on.  The concept the Antinet forces is that of working out your neuro-associative  recall “muscle.” It does this by forcing you to   think   and   associate . It requires  that you compare information you happen upon in your reading with the  knowledge stored in the long-term location within your second mind (your  Antinet). Only after this exercise of comparison can you actually install  information in your Antinet. Again, this process is not some best-practice  principle by which one might manually integrates information (such as in  a digital Zettelkasten workflow). Rather, it’s built into the core foundation  of the analog system. Every time you develop new knowledge, the Antinet  forces a process that models how the human brain works.

How -  ever, they do not possess the ability to install those new notes. They do not  have the ability to exercise neuro-associative recall and delineate   where   each  new idea they encounter should be stored. Basically, they have no index box  which enables them to navigate their tree of knowledge.  CONCLUSION  We’ve covered quite a bit in this chapter. We’ve surveyed the history of  numeric-alpha addresses. We’ve also explored the science and fundamental  components of such. Numeric-alpha addresses unlock a critical aspect of  the Antinet: links. We’ve gone into detail on the different types of links, as  well as the memory science behind links.  At this point you’re beginning to understand the depth of the Antinet.  This isn’t some trivial notebox system. It’s much greater than that. In the  next chapter, we’ll dive deeper into the depths of the Antinet. We’ll cover  another critical component which makes the Antinet the ultimate system  for developing knowledge: its tree structure.  53   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory.

247  C H A PT E R E I G H T  �  TREE  “ [The Antinet has] the possibility of arbitrary internal branching. We do not need  to add notes at the end, but we can connect them anywhere—even to a particular  word in the middle of a continuous text .”  –Niklas Luhmann,   Communication with Noteboxes 1  I n this section i detail   the structure of the Antinet. In brief, I hold that  the best representation of the Antinet’s structure is a   tree . The idea of using  a tree as a metaphor of Antinet-like knowledge systems is not new. In fact,  it’s a rather ancient idea. Early modern scholars referred to their Antinet  systems as   sylva , which in Latin means “forest.” It was described in this  manner due to an Antinet’s characteristic of “arranged chaos.” 2  I contend that the very best systems possess tree-like structures. For instance,  Github is built on a tree-like structure called   Git . When Github arrived to  the version-control arena (i.e., the arena of managing different software  versions), Git quickly blew away the other systems. The other systems were  rife with horrid version conflicts and syncing issues.  1   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

248      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The tree structure of the Antinet creates many of the system’s irreplaceable  benefits. Benefits include increasing the likelihood of breakthrough insights  by way of surprise, and many more benefits.  In addition, there’s a metaphysical power to the idea of tree-like structures.  Not only do tree structures have applications of the practical sort, trees serve  as a very powerful symbol. Indeed, trees stand as the central motif for some  of humankind’s most moving belief systems. All of these items, and more,  will be explored in detail in this chapter.  TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES  Before we dive into the structure of the Antinet, let’s survey a few types of  knowledge structures.  THE “RIGID” STRUCTURE  The so-called “rigid” knowledge structure is reflected in systems that are  organized by hierarchical taxonomy. This type of structure can be represented  in folders and sub-folders in a computer file system.  The basic structure looks like this:  –   Topic 1  *   Subtopic 1  *   Sub-subtopic 1  *   Etc.  –   Topic 2  –   Etc.  Examples of systems that use this structure include (1) the Dewey Decimal  Classification System, (2) the Library of Congress Classification System,  and (3) notebox systems organized by topic or category.  It’s become commonplace for personal knowledge management (“PKM”)  experts to advise against these rigid structures. 3   However, it is unfair to write  3   “1c.3 Using Folders—LYT Curriculum / Unit 1 - PKM & Idea Emergence,” Linking Your
249 TREE     off such structures completely. They’re useful in that they keep things simple  and easy to understand. Still, rigid structures lack the features that make the  Antinet great: linking thoughts, developing thoughts, and creating a unique  personality   out of your system that evolves over time.  THE “FLUID” STRUCTURE  When rigid structures are introduced by PKM experts, they’re implied as  being “bad.” The “good” structure is then introduced: so-called   fluid   structures.  Fluid structures are types of systems built with tags, keyword search, and  wikilinks. These structures allow users to create linked bubble graphs that  give the illusion of viewing your mind.  For instance, a graph like this:  photo credit : Sbae2020, English: Knowledge Graph for  Evans-Tibbs Artists, August 2021, August 2021, Own work,  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:KnowledgeGraph02.png.  However, these structures are a mere illusion. They’re pretty to look at;  however they are not the best structure for developing and evolving thought.

250      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Rather than being a useful representation of your brain, think of such struc -  tures as a pile of leaves on the ground with vines that connect them.  Digital Zettelkasten systems look much like this structure. You’re left with  either a blob of loosely connected spoke-wheel bubbles, or a needlessly  long document of notes. This is not the best way for your brain to process  information. Nor is it the best way to create knowledge. It’s not representative  of how human memory works, either.  Your memory, and more specifically, each individual memory, is akin to a  tree. Yes, a tree. A tree wherein certain leaves, attached via vines, are lit up  with a lightning bolt of activity (kind of like Christmas tree lights).  In the science of human memory, this is known as   distributed representation . 4  The Antinet’s structure is built with   distributed representation   in its core.  Digital Zettelkasten apps do not possess such a structure. They are based  on surface-level   wikilinks , not on a branched and chain-linked structures of  associations (generated by numeric-alpha addresses). This is one of many  4   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory. (New York: Oxford University  Press, 2014), 26.
251 TREE     reasons I hold the Antinet as a superior knowledge system compared to  digital notetaking apps (with wikilink capabilities).  With the Antinet, the structure is different. It’s not a pile of leaves. It’s a  rough anti-fragile   tree .  THE ROUGH STRUCTURE OF THE ANTINET  The magic of the Antinet is not in how   rigid   or how   fluid   it is. The magic is  in the   roughness   of the structure.  This seems to run counter to the ideology propped up by PKM practitioners  and so-called “Note-taking experts.” Such people propose systems more  analogous to what’s currently trendy. The sexy buzzwords of today are things  like   decentralization ,   openness ,   atomicity   and   dynamic   systems. Naturally, every  PKM expert seemingly integrates such terms into their gospel of notetaking.  Yet Luhmann’s system does not reflect the popular buzzwords of today. It’s  not a   decentralized ,   open ,   atomic ,   dynamic   system.  The Antinet is closer to being the exact opposite, in fact.  It’s centralized—in that you, its creator, make all of the decisions.  It’s closed—in that it’s a cybernetic system wherein each card has its own  numeric-alpha address; therefore, the cards containing numeric-alpha  addresses are effectively closed inside the system. The system can expand  and evolve, yet the expansion and branching happens   internally . The roots,  stems, and branches of the system grow deeper.  It’s   molecular   more than atomic. Each note can run onto the next note. The  whole   one idea per note   notion is a myth propagated by Sönke Ahrens. The  Antinet is made up of many chain-linked structures, and they do not sub -  scribe to the idea of strict   atomicity .  It’s not a dynamic system. You can’t find-and-replace-all. You can’t updated  and delete your thoughts freely on a whim. You can’t refactor your notes
252      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  (and thereby procrastinate on actually doing work). The Antinet’s structure,  including the notes within it, is more marcescent in nature than dynamic  (which we’ll cover shortly).  THE ROUGH TREE STRUCTURE GIVES THE  SYSTEM PERSONALITY  “ Natural and diagrammatic representations of trees come in many  varieties, each with its own charm, virtues, and uses. Some trees  are broad and shallow, others are narrow and deep; some trees  are balanced with fixed depth, others have varying branching  factors and erratic depth .”  —Ben Shneiderman,   The Book of Trees 5  The reason it’s important that the Antinet possesses such   rough   properties is  because it gives the system   personality . As previously mentioned, the unique  structure enables the system to transform into a   second mind . It enables it to  develop an   alter ego , as Luhmann calls it. 6  The Antinet’s structure gives it a sense of uniqueness and distinction. It’s a  system that cannot be freely reorganized and edited. You cannot rename  every file on a whim based on whatever new convention you fall in love  with. The digital notetaking apps suffer from this freedom. Unlike digital  systems, the Antinet does not allow for refactoring of notes en masse. You  cannot waste time dragging and dropping notes into different subfolders  at a later date. You cannot dynamically update all of the links in files. You  cannot retroactively integrate some new metadata or front-matter scheme  that you delude yourself into believing will make you more productive.  5   Manuel Lima, The Book of Trees: Visualizing Branches of Knowledge, Illustrated edi -  tion (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2014), 8.  6   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

253 TREE     Rather, the Antinet forces you to do two things: first, to think, and second,  to evolve thoughts. If you’re looking for a system that focuses on everything  else, then digital notetaking apps serve as a better alternative.  All of the things the Antinet cannot do are in fact the very elements which con -  tribute to its most important function:   to generate breakthrough creative insights .  These creative insights are generated through the element of   surprise , which  the Antinet’s structure is uniquely positioned to provide. More on   surprises  and the surprise-generating functions of the Antinet will be discussed in a  later chapter.  Suffice it to say, the   rough   structure of the Antinet forces—or actually, encour -  ages—users to ask questions they otherwise would never ask. A digital system,  with fully-indexed file searching, only enables the lazy act of searching for  a keyterm the user is thinking of   at that precise time .  With the Antinet, things aren’t that simple.  The Antinet forces you to ask:   What’s the name of the concept I’m thinking of?  And if an answer is not forthcoming, then a process kicks into gear wherein  you ask another set of questions:   What is the concept I’m thinking of related  to? Where else would it make sense for the concept to be? What other variant  terms point to the concept?   If that’s unsuccessful, you may then wish to create  a new stem of thought for the concept. And because it was so hard to find  the concept, you are then incentivized to create a keyterm in the index. That  way, you’ll be able to find it more quickly in the future.  What about the original concept you were looking for that you never found?  In my experience, any concept, if it’s important enough, always turns up one  way or another. Your Antinet is less of a black hole than digital notetaking  apps are. Whenever you do stumble across the concept again, you can then  create a remotelink to it, thereby connecting the two disparate stems of  thought. In turn this creates an even richer structure of knowledge.  This entire exercise results in several things taking place in the brain. First, you
254      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  approach the concept in a fun way, using   associative thinking , which actually  improves mood. 7   Second, during this process you stumble upon profound  surprises you now recognize as connected. Last, you trigger   internal dialogue .  Your current mind, with its own active present memory and consciousness,  communicates with your   past self   (your past mind) as revealed on the note -  cards. This process, like communication, results in surprises.  If nothing else, the core process of the Antinet centers on this communi -  cation process that allows the Antinet to become a “surprise generator,” as  Johannes Schmidt refers to it. 8  ORDER VS. CHAOS  A critical thing to keep in mind is that   pure order   is undesirable (as is pure  chaos). While the Dewey Decimal Classification System makes sense in  theory, it and other such rigid systems also stand problematic. How so? They  do not accurately reflect reality. The categories of such systems are static;  they do not evolve, morph, or grow.  Luhmann’s system started with   rough   categories and then evolved from there.  The reason I do not refer to the Antinet as a   rigid   structure is because the  Antinet is more   organic   in nature. Johannes Schmidt, who is most familiar  with Luhmann’s system, also refers to it as “a rough structure.” 9   Like nature,  the Antinet is rough. It’s antifragile, as Nassim Nicholas Taleb would say. 10  It gets stronger with randomness, volatility and disorder. It follows certain  laws and adheres to certain conventions. It’s also a structure subjected to  7   Moshe Bar, “A Cognitive Neuroscience Hypothesis of Mood and Depression,” Trends in  Cognitive Sciences 13, no. 11 (November 2009): 456–63.  8   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

255 TREE     complete accidents, random chance, and surprise. The system, in brief,  mirrors reality. It mirrors both order and chaos.  Early on in life, Niklas Luhmann realized the world isn’t a simple dualistic  affair ( good vs. evil ). Recall, he learned this particularly from being captured  and tortured by the supposed “good guys” at the end of World War II. The  world is complex, and so is the human mind.  The question becomes   How can one devise a system built on that which reflects  chaos, yet also possess some physical laws of order binding it together, in order to  navigate such complexity?  It was with this question in mind that Luhmann crafted the structure of  the Antinet.  THE ANTINET AS AN ACTUAL TREE  “ The distributions and partitions of knowledge are not like several  lines that meet in one angle, and so touch but in a point; but are  like branches of a tree, that meet in a stem, which hath a dimen -  sion and quantity of entireness and continuance, before it comes  to discontinue and break itself into arms and boughs .”  –Francis Bacon 11  While it’s accurate to describe the structure of the Antinet as   rough , roughness  is a   property   of the system, and not the actual structure.  Instead of thinking of the Antinet as a   fluid   structure, or   rigid   structure, or  even a hybrid of that dichotomy (a   rough   structure), I hold that the best way  to think of the Antinet is as a   tree —a   real tree .  11   Manuel Lima, The Book of Trees: Visualizing Branches of Knowledge, Illustrated edi -  tion (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2014), 14.
256      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The idea of using a tree to metaphorically represent the structure of human  knowledge is not new. The first metaphorical tree used to represent human  knowledge dates back to sometime between AD 268 and 270. 12   This first  metaphorical tree of knowledge is known as the Porphyrian tree, named  after Greek philosopher and logician Porphyry. The Porphyrian tree reframed  and developed Aristotle’s classification scheme by presenting it in tree form .  12   Manuel Lima, The Book of Trees: Visualizing Branches of Knowledge, Illustrated edition  (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2014), 44.

258      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  It’s important to look to nature as our primary source in forming our under -  standing of reality. “I think that I shall never see a poem as lovely as a tree,”  writes Aldous Huxley. 13   By this Huxley was referring to the concept that  platonic abstractions can only do so much. True beauty and reality are best  represented by nature itself. It’s best to think of the Antinet as an   actual   tree,  and not merely as a computer science representation of one.  Looking first to nature—and specifically trees—results in creating useful  abstractions for managing knowledge. It’s important to first look to nature  for inspiration, as opposed to looking at some other platonic abstraction  for information. Looking to nature first is actually what inspired a useful  visual innovation in computer science called rectangular treemaps. Its  originator, Ben Shneiderman writes, “The recursive branching structure  of trees, which provides a compelling metaphor for organizing knowledge,  was at the forefront of my mind as I developed the rectangular treemap as a  means to display the nested structure of folders on a computers hard drive.” 14  The lesson is that actual, real trees, are the best metaphor to think of when  devising the structure of your own Antinet.  Trees are not only useful, but also fundamentally critical in explaining the  truth of reality. Charles Darwin writes, “The affinities of all the beings of  the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe  this simile largely speaks the truth.” 15   In fact, in Darwin’s seminal book   On  The Origin of Species , the only illustration in the entire book is a tree structure. 16  13   Dana Sawyer, Aldous Huxley: A Biography (Trillium Press, 2015), 161.  14   Manuel Lima, The Book of Trees: Visualizing Branches of Knowledge, Illustrated edition  (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2014), 7.  15   Charles Darwin and Julian Huxley, The Origin of Species: 150th Anniversary Edition,  Reprint, Anniversary edition (Signet, 2009), 126.  16   Manuel Lima, The Book of Trees: Visualizing Branches of Knowledge, Illustrated edi -  tion (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2014), 39.

It is an odd looking affair, but is   indispensable   to show the  nature of the very complex affinities of past & present animals.

This version effectively breaks apart the Bible into branches and stems of  thought. You essentially follow one branch’s verse. When you get to the  verse, in the page margin is a chain-link to another verse somewhere else  in the Bible. For instance, if you follow the verse of a prophecy in the Old  Testament, the structure then takes you to a verse in the New Testament  wherein Jesus references the prophecy.  The Thompson Chain Reference Bible is actually quite similar to the Antinet.  However, the leaves of the Antinet aren’t verses, they’re notecards.  In sum, using an actual tree as inspiration for knowledge has been proven  throughout history to be a powerful metaphor. Luhmann’s Antinet embodied  this tree-like structure, and it only makes sense we continue to fully embrace it.  Components of the Antinet’s Tree Structure  To illustrate how an Antinet reflects a tree structure, think of it like this: 18  18   Keep in mind, the numbers provided are only illustrative, every Antinet will differ in its

For instance: 4000 which  represents   Formal Sciences , and 4212 which represents   Information Science .     The   stems   are the individual collections and streams of thoughts that usually  are created together. For instance: 4214/1 a /1, 4214/1 a /2, 4214/1 a /3. In  this case, the   stem   is 1 a .     The   leaves   are the individual notecards. For instance, 4214/1 a /1, 4214/1 a /2,  4214/1 a /3. These three cards represent three individual leaves.     The   vines   are   remotelinks   that allow you to swing from one area in your  tree of knowledge to another. In the field of human memory science, they’re  akin to   remote associations . For instance, within 4214/1A/2 you can link to  a remote area like 2431/2 a . When you do this, you’re effectively swinging  from a vine on 4214/1 a /2 to 2431/2 a .  MARCESCENT THOUGHTS  In the fields of botany and zoology, the term   persistence   refers to the part of  a plant or animal that is of a nature wherein it remains attached to the ani -  mal. Yet there are some phenomena in nature where plants or animals keep  parts of themselves you’d expect them to shed. For instance, one normally  expects trees to shed their dead leaves. However, have you ever noticed that  certain trees do not do so? This is a phenomenon called   marcescence . It’s a  rarity among all of the species of trees, yet certain trees—like beech trees—  do not shed spent leaves. 19  Like literal trees, each person’s tree of knowledge residing in their mind  does not shed   leaves , but   thoughts . Some leaves, like some thoughts, grow  brown and stale before they are shed. Other leaves are useful. For instance,  morphology. The numbers you use are arbitrary.  19   Tom Oder, “Why Do the Leaves of Some Trees Turn Brown but Not Drop?,” Treehugger,  accessed   August   11,   2021,   https://www.treehugger.com/marcescence-why-leaves-some-  trees-turn-brown-not-drop-4863742.

Indeed, shedding some types of thoughts are certainly welcomed by many of  us! Yet the latest research in cognitive neuroscience shows that the average  person experiences about 6,200 thoughts per day. 21   Many of these thoughts  are useful, yet they need some time in the sun to fully sprout and develop.  Unfortunately, most of your thoughts never have the time to sprout and  develop. They never have the chance to be ruminated on and await their  time to shine.  Productivity junkies try to address this problem by devising systematized  digital workflows. The goal centers around capturing   more   information, and  storing such in a single repository. Yet, this isn’t the solution. Capturing  more information is not the solution. Rather, capturing less information,  and developing more knowledge is.  Information overload is the very thing Luhmann figured out how to avoid.  By way of metaphor, Luhmann’s system transforms one’s mind into a per -  sistent, supercharged version of itself. Luhmann devised a knowledge struc -  ture for his thoughts which transformed his mind into something capable of  marcescence, able to retain its key thoughts persistently—forever.  You see, over the course of the days, weeks, months, years, and even decades,  your Antinet transforms. It evolves naturally and slowly thanks to the marc -  escent phenomenon of never shedding its leaves. Its ultimately indescribable,  unforeseeable structure corresponds not just to your mind—but to every  instance of your mind’s thoughts.

Your tree of knowledge does not shed its  thoughts, it grows and evolves them, thereby enabling you to evolve with  your marcescent mind. By constantly communicating with your Antinet,  you natively structure thoughts based on where it makes the most sense  at the time. You retain your thoughts and evolve them for as long as you  communicate with the system.  This illustration largely relies on metaphor but it reflects the truth of using  an Antinet in practice. You’ll begin to understand the more you use it.  ON HIERARCHIES  Your tree of knowledge is the Antinet. The leaves on the tree of knowledge  represent notecards. Each of these notecards is of the same class and status  in terms of their theoretical importance.  In an Antinet, there is no hierarchical superiority. As Johannes Schmidt  says, “the position of special subject or card says nothing of the theoretical  importance of the card.” 22   As far as hierarchy goes, as Schmidt says, “there’s  no bottom and there’s no top.” 23  One thing people have difficulty comprehending is how the Antinet   does  not   employ a hierarchical taxonomy.  Taxonomy comes from the Greek roots   taxis   and   nomos .   Taxis   means   order ,  and   nomos , means   science . Essentially, taxonomy refers to the science of  order. However, the Antinet, as Luhmann writes, is a system of both “order  and disorder.” 24   It’s a system not trying to make a   science   of   order . It’s not  trying to make order out of chaos. Rather it’s a system that embraces chaos  without becoming overwhelmed by it.

264      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  from going crazy with too much chaos are the numeric-alpha addresses and  the tree structure.  The numeric-alpha addresses alone are not enough for the system to thrive.  That’s where the   branch separators   come into play. Branch separators are the  special characters that fork off a thought into a new branch or stem. They’re  characters like forward-slashes, periods, or commas. 25  Some may interpret that whatever comes   after   the branch separator is some -  how of a lower-status on the perceived hierarchy. In reality, this is not the  case. In fact, as Luhmann confirms, “the positioning of a subject within this  system of organization reveals nothing about its theoretical importance for  there exist no privileged positions in this web of notes.” 26  Here’s an illustration showing how there are no   privileged positions   in the  Antinet’s structure: Luhmann’s most important work is his   Theory of Society .  In his Antinet, Luhmann placed a section for a major project pertaining to  his most important work in a very discrete location: 21/3d7f b . 27   This loca -  tion falls under several other branches which are seemingly less important.  When looking at this, it becomes clear that the rank of the importance of a  thought is not reflected in its position within the Antinet.  NOTES ARE IN A POSITION, NOT IN A RANK  Each numeric-alpha address pertaining to each note lives in a specific location  indicated by its fixed address. Similar to a latitude-longitude coordinate, notes  in an Antinet reside at a certain address that is not a ranked order of contents.

265 TREE     branching . This is important because it allows the system to shift and evolve  in unexpected ways.  The Antinet is composed of thoughts that can be visualized as leaves. Like  leaves, some grow stale and some new ones grow between others. They’re  always changing. Some leaves turn brown and dry up. Other areas on your  tree unexpectedly grow and flourish. As Luhmann himself states, “some  things fade away; some notes are never seen again.” 28   Yet the reason you  should allow this to occur centers on the opposite scenario. Ideas you had  which were “initially positioned so as to play a minor role [in what you’re  working on] come to dominate the system.” 29  Alternatively, you’ll also have thoughts you initially believed would play  a major role in your work. Yet the thoughts end up not evolving or being  developed at all. This can happen due to the initial excitement for the idea  wearing off. Or, this can happen when thoughts lack additional support  from your future readings. Both of these stands as a good thing. You don’t  want to continue developing an idea that no longer seems relevant or useful.  This is something that happens naturally in an Antinet.  This highlights the power of internal branching.  The power of internal branching was not realized by Luhmann alone. Others  scholars observed the power of such as well. One scholar writes, “the card  index is open-ended not only in a physical sense—new file cards and new  entries can be added to existing ones without limits—but also in a struc -  tural sense.” 30   Yet the numeric-alpha addresses also enclose this open-ended  system in a cybernetic network. That is, numeric-alpha addresses create a  28   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

In essence,  the system is open-ended, but only in the sense that it grows more complex  inwardly instead of externally. The tree of knowledge gets denser and denser.  It becomes filled with more leaves, branches, stems, and vines over time.  The internal branching is made possible through the Antinet’s structure: its  fixed order of positioning   each leaf on the tree.  As Johannes Schmidt says, it’s best not to think of the system as “an order of  contents,” but as a “fixed order of positioning.” 31   By   fixed order of positioning ,  he alludes to the   spatial   implications of a thought. A thought doesn’t exist in  the ether, but can be assigned to a certain position in physical space.  This mirrors how ancient Greek thinkers implemented mnemonic techniques  to aid memorization: “If the recollection of things and words is based on  semantic associations triggered by images,   then these images must be placed  somewhere . This arrangement cannot be chaotic; it must follow an order  that in turn may be   easily memorized .” 32   By   must be placed somewhere , think  of numeric-alpha addresses and installing your notes in long-term storage.  By   easily memorized , consider the the tree-like structure of the Antinet, as  well as the index. One can logically trace the area where the note should be  filed after looking up the keyterm in the index.  Links and Reverberation  Internal branching enables you to be pulled deeper into thoughts that are  more developed. Yet, internal branching isn’t the only mechanism in the  Antinet that facilitates this. Johannes Schmidt points out that the parts of the  Antinet that are poorly linked, or not even linked at all, result in becoming  isolated later on, in part because isolated elements lack   reverberation . 33  31   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

267 TREE     Reverberation, a concept that appears throughout this book, relates to  “just-experienced associations” setting off a chain reaction of thought. During  this period, the concept and the associations are easier to recall. 34  After you’ve triggered a reverberation event, over the next several days, the  association and connection is given a new lease on life, opening the possibility  of those thoughts colliding with new ideas related to your current thoughts  and recent discoveries. This enables ideas to evolve.  Reverberation is a necessary ingredient for the evolution of thoughts. Rever -  beration is attained through creating and re-experiencing linked thoughts.  As can be expected, this experience of reverberation, relying exclusively on links  as it is, is significantly wiped away with digital keyword search functionality.  When you navigate around your Antinet by way of using associations (links),  you are building your memory. You’re building memory in the short term  by triggering reverberation events, and you’re stamping the potential of  re-triggering reverberation events in the long term.  Reverberation is also super-charged and strengthened over time via the  practice of writing by hand. You see, reverberation transitions an idea into  “supersonic mode” within your mind for months (if not years and decades)  by way of neuroimprinting ideas on your mind. The reason why this is  important is because it enables you to recall the idea when faced with a new  idea that contradicts the one still reverberating in your mind. Reverberation,  in turn, serves as a self-deception filter for your thoughts.  The tree structure of the Antinet (with its internal branching), as well as  links made possible by way of numeric-alpha addresses, enables reverbera -  tion to be elevated to a whole new level.

ASSOCIATIVE CHAINING  Let’s take a look at two types of structures for organizing knowledge: (1)  Associative Bubbles, and (2) Associative Chaining.  Associative Bubbles  Associative bubble structures contain one link type with no strength differen -  tiation. Think of these as simple links or wikilinks in a typical notetaking app.  These aren’t very sophisticated graphs of knowledge, nor are they reflective  of how human memory works. The reason centers around the fact that  there are no relations between the core branches. For instance, the relations  between A, B, and C, are broken in the associative bubble diagram shown.  Yet, for some reason, associative bubbles are the most popular structures  used in digital notetaking apps today.  Associative Chaining  In comparison, there’s   associative chaining , which stems from the science of  human memory. It also reflects the structure of the Antinet.
269 TREE     With associative chaining, every single thought is linked by proximity, and  the nearest neighbors have the strongest links. There are both forward links,  and backward links. However the backwards links are of a weaker association.  HIERARCHICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE ANTINET  If you look closely at the diagram of associative chaining, you’ll see that   a 5  stems into   a 5/1 and   a 5/2, which stems into   a 5/2 a . Within the field of memory  science, this concept is known as “chunking” or “hierarchical association.” 35  This term   hierarchical association   illustrates a key point. The Antinet’s struc -  ture is not   hierarchically ordered , but is rather   hierarchically associated —with  no implication of any special status granted to the order or rank of the note.  Merely, notes are organized in a   hierarchical association   based on structure  alone (not based on content).  35   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory. (New York: Oxford University  Press, 2014), 307.
270      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Hierarchical association models (aka,   chunking   models) are based on the  idea that sequences have   natural breakpoints   dividing words, numbers, and  thoughts. By dividing the sequence of items, they’re organized into smaller  components (aka,   chunks ). 36  This is not a hierarchical rank indicating importance, however. Within  the science of human memory, items correlated with the stem of a tree  structure, comprising chunks of more related items, are thought of as “rep -  resenting more elementary attributes” of the idea. The branches and items  found closer to the trunk of the tree are thought of as “representing more  abstract structures.” 37  By navigating to one section (or chunk) of leaves on your tree of knowl -  edge, you can navigate   upstem   to other branches, and   downstem   into other  sections of leaves.  Within the science of human memory this is referred to as retrieving abstract  “superordinate” items from memory and accessing more elemental chunks.  In turn you may “retrieve the other items associated [with the memory]”  (which is similar in nature to associative chaining). 38  Though this concept is referred to as a hierarchical associative model, it’s  not a traditional hierarchy, but one built on “abstract structures” and “more  elementary attributes.” 39   It’s a structure more akin to a   tree   than a hierarchy  connoting relative importance.  The latest explorations in memory science have begun to use tree structures  in their models.  36   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory.

271 TREE     For instance, the concept of chain-structured   long short-term memory   (LSTM)  has come to dominate the field of machine learning and data mining. LTSM  has proven itself effective at solving a wide-range of problems. This includes  problems in the field of speech recognition and machine translation. This  model (referred to as S-LSTM) is now being extended by using tree structures,  and researchers have found that the performance of this tree-structured  model yields better results than LSTM alone. 40  UNDERSTANDING THE ANTI-HIERARCHY OF THE  ANTINET COMES FROM PERSONAL EMPIRICAL  EXPERIMENTATION  It’s hard to conceive of the Antinet as   not   being a hierarchical system unless  you actually experience it yourself (spending time building out your own  Antinet and working with it). Until then, it may be helpful to look at hier -  archical systems to comprehend the difference.  TOPICS, CATEGORIES AND FUZZY  CATEGORIES  An easy way to tell an Antinet system apart from a conventional notebox  system is that the notebox system is organized by category alone (without  any numerical conventions). If it contains groupings such as Courage, Sto -  icism, etc., then it’s not an Antinet.  With this said, labeling an Antinet as a system   not   organized by cate -  gory is incorrect. Long story short, the Antinet has an odd relationship  with categories.  Indeed, one does organize the Antinet by categories by assigning keyterms  to point to a certain numeric-alpha address. However, the Antinet   self-or -  ganizes itself   by those numeric-alpha addresses. Basically,   you   organize the  Antinet by keyterms and categories, while the Antinet organizes itself by  addresses (not by categories).  40   Xiaodan Zhu, Parinaz Sobhani, and Hongyu Guo, “Long Short-Term Memory Over Tree  Structures,” ArXiv:1503.04881   Cs , March 16, 2015, http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04881, 1.
272      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Luhmann organized his second Antinet by creating eleven top-level cat -  egories. However, over the years his system organized itself based on the  numeric-alpha addresses.  So, in effect, Luhmann technically   did   organize the system by cat -  egories and topics; however, over time, and as more cards were added,  it self-organized itself using numeric-alpha addresses, with the addresses  going far beyond (and deeper into) the categories and topics Luhmann  started with. This allowed his Antinet to morph way beyond any notion of  preconceived categories.  That the initial categorizing indicates a hierarchical system is a misconcep -  tion and myth carried forth and held by many Zettelkasten practitioners.  THE NATURE OF CATEGORY-BASED  KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS  I contend that category-based knowledge systems cater to simpler theories  and simpler material (i.e., mass-appeal books). This isn’t necessarily a bad  thing. I do not wish to impart negative judgment on mass-appeal books;  I simply wish to impart a critique that other notebox systems organized by  simple and clear topics, end up producing more simplified work.  It’s easy to discount category-based notecard systems based on their sim -  plicity, compared with an Antinet system; however, I prefer not to discount  them totally.  Category-based systems serve as a more appropriate choice if one wishes  to write general books for the general public. For instance, Ryan Holiday,  Elizabeth Gilbert, and Robert Greene use topic-organized notebox systems.  Their books essentially take simple ideas and concepts and provide useful  stories, reflections, and excerpts to support their views.  For instance, an author might take a concept like   courage, make a category  in their notebox,   and then add cards with excerpts, stories, and reflections  about courage in that category.
273 TREE     This helps produce simpler, easier-to-read books organized by very broad  topics; however, it also contributes to several downsides: (1) it risks   over-sim -  plifying   the concept and therefore misinterpreting reality, and (2) it risks  steering the author toward saying something that is not groundbreaking  or new.  The problem with classification systems built on clear categories and topics  is that they do not exist in nature.  As the linguist George Lakoff observed, “Pristine categories are fictions.” 41  Categories are artifacts of the human tendency to seek clear definitions of  a phenomenon—even if it’s too complex to be assigned a clear definition.  This tendency was inherited from Aristotle, and we must shed this habit. 42  Fuzzy Categories  As Steven Pinker points out, when you use a microscope to zoom in on any -  thing, that thing’s boundaries turn fuzzy. This introduces a concept Pinker  refers to as   fuzzy categories , a concept that is similar to the idea of the   rough  structure and rough categories the Antinet is built upon. 43  You cannot create genius-level work if you’re confined to thinking about  whatever category is popular, or even thinkable.  Moreover, categories tend to induce certain OCD tendencies. One begins  to major in the minor. This introduces something I call the   classifier’s fallacy .  The Collector’s Fallacy and the Classifier’s Fallacy  The   classifier’s fallacy   derives its inspiration from something Christian Tietze  calls the   collector’s fallacy , the tendency to collet information without actually  processing and understanding it through elaboration (such as by making  41   Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works, Norton pbk (New York: Norton, 2009), 311.  42   Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works, Norton pbk (New York: Norton, 2009), 311.  43   Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works, Norton pbk (New York: Norton, 2009), 310-2.

The  Catholic intellectual and philosopher Antonin Sertillanges observed the  trap of the collector’s fallacy in the early 1920s. “We must beware of a certain  craze for collecting which sometimes takes possession of those who makes  notes,” writes Sertillanges. 45  Just as harmful as the collector’s fallacy is that of the   classifier’s fallacy . With  category-based systems, one experiences the tendency to obsess over clas -  sifications, notably in deciding which category a note belongs to or over the  hierarchical structure of one’s classification system. “Excessive attention to  classification interferes with use,” warns Sertillanges. 46   This is something  the Antinet’s structure helps stave off. After some time working with the  Antinet, users become comfortable enough with the chaos that arises and  are able to face the temptations without falling prey to the time-sucking  dithering over classifications  Here’s the deal. Luhmann did not become “the most important German  sociologist in the 20th century” through   thinking conventionally . 47   He came  to be known as such by thinking   unconventionally . The system Luhmann  used promotes   unconventional interactions . It is a system of chaos founded on  simple rules of order. If an author desires to create best-selling books with  simplified ideas (at risk of being simplistic), perhaps he or she should opt  for a simpler system of organizing his or her knowledge.

275 TREE     The fuzzy categories and structure of the Antinet, on the other hand, prevent  it from falling into the trap of oversimplifying reality, leading to deeper, more  unconventional, and complex work (for better, or worse).  One of Luhmann’s intellectual rivals held a more conventional framework  for his theory of society. The man is named Jürgen Habermas. In Robert  Greene’s book,   The Laws of Human Nature , its contents are organized by  categories like   Irrationality ,   Narcissism ,   Shortsightedness ,   Envy , and others.  Habermas’s work is conventionally laid out in a similar manner. One finds  a table of contents with ideas which were considered conventional within  the dominant school of social theory at the time (known as the Frankfurt  School). In the mid-1980s Luhmann was asked whether he thought Haber -  mas used an Antinet system like Luhmann himself did. Luhmann’s tart reply  is classic: “For [Habermas’s] theory, simple [categories] of order seems to  be sufficient.” 48  In brief, conventional systems tend to produce conventional thoughts. The  Antinet results in a structure that produces thoughts pulled across many  contexts and that dances with complexity. The system is built upon similarity  and it links ideas that, at first glance, don’t seem similar at the time when you  go back to write about a section. However, upon closer look, the structure  yields some fascinating clusters that would have otherwise been impossible to  create if one compartmentalizes every thought into conventional containers.  THE DOWNSIDES OF CATEGORY-BASED SYSTEMS  Now, let’s explore some of the downsides of category-based systems.  Duplicating Cards Leads to Diminishing  Neuroimprinting Returns  Ryan Holiday uses a notecard system organized by categories (like   Life ,  Anticipation ,   Death , and   Strategy ). His cards are not individually addressed.  Rather, you’ll find the name of a category in the top-right corner.  48   Undisciplined, Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt, 2021, https://www.youtube.  com/watch?v=kz2K3auPLWU, 18:27.
276      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  When using a category-based system, one often faces the dilemma of a card  that can be filed in multiple categories. For instance, a card that fits both into  the   Anticipation   category and the   Strategy   category. In such a case, Holiday’s  advice is simple: “Just make a duplicate card.” 49  While this is not ideal, it’s not terribly bad, either. After all, you gain the  benefits of neuroimprinting the idea on your mind. However, writing an  idea down multiple times does run up against the law of diminishing returns.  There’s simply   too much to know , as Ann Blair would say. There’s a risk that  the excerpt you write down multiple times will prove useless to your work.  Also, the idea of copying out reflection notes (which I’ll detail later), may  span across several cards, is rather impractical in the long term.  Holiday’s solution to this problem sheds light on one of the several inad -  equacies of category-based systems. You see, Luhmann faced the same  problem of trying to figure out which keyterm best encapsulated an idea.  Yet because of the self-referential nature of the Antinet (made possible by  numeric-alpha addresses), all Luhmann had to do was simply create a card  that said,   For more on this concept, see card   ‘ 3411/2A. ’ I call this type of card  a   hoplink card , which will be covered later. Oftentimes, however, Luhmann  wouldn’t create a card with only links on it. There was frequently enough  space on any given card to just create a cardlink to the related idea.  DUPLICATING CARDS PREVENTS FEEDBACK  SIGNALS IN NOTETAKING SYSTEMS  In addition to the diminishing returns achieved by writing out the same card  multiple times, there is something lacking in such a system.  You see, one of the things that has held back notetaking systems is the lack  of   feedback . Whenever you release a new book or piece of work out into  the world, you’re met with feedback. Sometimes there’s an audience for  49   Ryan Holiday, “The Notecard System: The Key For Remembering, Organizing And  Using Everything You Read,” RyanHoliday.Net (blog), April 1, 2014, https://ryanhol -  iday.net/the-notecard-system-the-key-for-remembering-organizing-and-using-every -  thing-you-read/.
277 TREE     your work, sometimes there’s not, and sometimes it’s worse: people hate it.  However, every single one of those outcomes is fantastic. Feedback, even  negative feedback, enables you to learn from your efforts. In the field of  artificial intelligence, the entire system relies on feedback. The same holds  true for cybernetic networks, which is what an Antinet is. It’s a system with  a deliberate goal, and it’s a system that learns from feedback.  In notetaking systems, you’re rarely met with feedback because the system  is made for your eyes only (as it should be). It’s a system for you to process  thoughts, learn thoughts, and reflect on ideas. As such, you do not publish  the work, and thus, you don’t gain feedback. However, you should not  correct the lack of feedback in your notetaking system by publishing your  notes. That’s a waste of time.  But what are you to do if you wish to evolve your notetaking system, even  if you’ve not yet experienced the   feedback   signals necessary to evolve it?  One way to gain feedback signals relates to duplicate card entries.  When you create a duplicate card in the Antinet, it’s a feedback signal. It’s  not something you want to do, nor is it that likely to happen, because even  before you write a maincard, you should first peruse your Antinet to figure  out where it’s going to fit. Only after that point, do you then begin writing  the maincard (which is an excerpt note, a reformulation note, or a reflection  note). These will be detailed later. Bottom line: the practice of first figuring  out   where   you’ll install a new note prevents you from duplicating an already  created idea.  When you do create a duplicate card it tells you that your Antinet knows  more than you give it credit for. It sends a feedback signal to you that you  should spend more time with your Antinet perusing its contents, creating  index entries, and getting familiar with it.  Also, when you create a duplicate card it poses an interesting question:  were you going to file the duplicate card in a different location? If you  were going to file the card in a different location, it sends another signal.
278      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  It creates an opportunity to create links across those areas of your Antinet.  As a result, it creates an opportunity for accidents or surprises to occur  down the road.  THE BENEFITS OF CARDLINKS OVER WRITING  OUT COPIES OF DUPLICATE CARDS  Creating cardlinks, instead of copying out a duplicate card possesses  several advantages:  First, cardlinks eliminate the wasting of time and the accompanying dimin -  ished value of neuroimprinting multiple cards.  Second, cardlinks enrich the cybernetic network of the Antinet because you  end up creating a system with more connections. Effectively, the neurons in  your brain are enhanced through the making of many connections across  the network.  Third, cardlinks enable the Antinet to retain the structure necessary for  compounding   and evolving ideas over the long term. In comparison, cat -  egory-based systems confine the ideas to silos of information. The cards  cannot communicate between silos. At most, they can (merely) reference  top-level categories. For instance, they contain references like,   For more on  this, see the “Death” category . The system cannot reference a subsection of  cards or even an individual card within the   Death   category, which could  contain thousands of cards.  Fourth, cardlinks introduce the possibility of   surprise , and as a result,  the likelihood of inducing breakthrough insights are increased. In an  Antinet, when you encounter a remotelink, you’re often taken to a completely  different branch in the Antinet. In that branch you review stems of  thought and leaves that end up serving as the perfect material for what  you need.  For instance, right now while writing this section, an accidental surprise  occurred. In the following card (4214/5/0/1), you’ll see a green snippet of  text that says:   For instance, Hoplinks:   ‘ 4214/3H/4 ’
279 TREE   
280      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  When I navigated to 4214/3 h /4, I actually stumbled upon a very useful  surprise in a few cards placed immediately before 4214/3 h /4. The cards  were 4214/3 h /3 b   and 4214/3 h /3 b /1.
281 TREE     These cards pertain to the downsides of category-based systems. I had for -  gotten about this set of cards. The second card, 4214/3 h /3 b /1, reminded me  of another downside of category-based systems which formed the section  you’re about to read next. This all came by way of a surprise that generated  a breakthrough insight.  Yet even if my (re)discovery of the card 4214/3 h /3 b /1 didn’t come by way  of accident (thanks to the tree structure of the Antinet); it would have been  discovered by way of linking.  If I continued further along down the branch from the initial card,  (4214/5/0/1), I would have happened upon the card 4214/5/ b 2/1, which  points me to 4214/3 h /3 b /1. See the following note:  This provides a glimpse into the nature of working with an Antinet. It’s a  web-like system of chaos and order that introduces surprises. This makes it  more fun when it comes time to sit down and write the draft or manuscript  of whatever project you’re working on.
282      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Category-based Systems Lack the Benefits  of Association Based on Proximity  Another problem with category-based systems is the fact that they lack the  power of proximal association.  In the Antinet, the closer the cards are to one another, the more   associated  they are. This often comes from, (1) temporal-based creation of the notes,  and (2) from years of compounding and installing related notes nearby one  another. This mirrors how human memory works. The concept is known as  forward and backward associations . 50   Because of the numeric-alpha addresses,  one can count on building out a system based on   association . In a catego -  ry-based notecard system, if your cards ever get shuffled or mixed around,  it loses the associations that are evolved and compound over years (even  decades) based on proximal associations.  Category-based Systems Lack the Compounding  Features of The Antinet  The numeric-alpha addresses (compared with category-based systems), ensure  that the external mind you’re building models itself after the human brain.  The human brain is built around neurons and the connections between them.  As Alberto Cevolini observes, numbering systems do not “mirror the  order of the universe,” yet they’re no more unusual than alphabetically  organized systems based on categories. 51   By adopting numeric-alpha  addresses, it’s possible to shed the notion that the entire universe and reality  can be consolidated into easily understood categories. The numeric-alpha  addresses compel users to   develop completely different cognitive capacities . 52  This cognitive capacity results in “a truly   combinatory   ability to manage  knowledge.” 53   In other words, numeric-alpha addresses combined with the  50   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory.

283 TREE     tree structure of the Antinet, allows knowledge to   compound   and   combine  to create breakthrough insights.  Much of this concept was already covered in an earlier chapter discussing  the who and why of the Antinet. In that chapter, I touched upon where the  Antinet shines, which is when one is developing knowledge for the long  term. Category-based systems can certainly work; however, their real power  is experienced over the long term.  TREE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS  Luhmann’s first and second Zettelkasten did indeed contain top-level cate -  gories, yet they were not category-based systems. Numeric addresses were  affixed to the cards, and they were separated by branch separators (like “/”).  This enabled his thoughts to branch internally. The top-level branches were  more like   fuzzy categories . They were good starting points or areas from  which knowledge would develop. They retained the rough structure of trees.  However, I think it best to think of them as top-level branches instead of  top-level categories. Also, instead of calling Luhmann’s Antinet architecture  a classification system, I like to think of it as a   tree classification system .  THE LUHMANNIAN TREE  CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM  Luhmann started his fist Antinet in early 1950, when he was in his early  twenties. He did this to accumulate knowledge and extract concepts from  the books he was reading. He used his first Antinet to learn and understand  the ideas he was being introduced to in his readings. He had 108 top-level  branches in his first Antinet. The list of those branches can be found in  Appendix A.  Luhmann started his second Antinet with a focus on his sociological research  project (which he asserted would take thirty years to complete). In his second  Antinet, there were eleven top-level branches. The list of those branches can  be found in   Appendix B .  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016), 28.  Emphasis added.
284      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The Luhmannian Tree in Practice  For an example of the tree structure in practice, let’s turn to Luhmann’s  second Antinet, the one that contained eleven top-level branches.  Each of the branches contained subsections (which I call sub-branches).  As Johannes Schmidt points out, “each of these subsections was assigned a  numerical prefix of up to four digits.” 54   For instance, 3411 for   Ideology .  Here’s an example:  –   3 General decision theory  *   31 Concept of action  *   32 Models of decision-making  *   33 Types of decision-making model designs  *   331 Utilitarian models  *   332 Optimizing model  *   333 Satisfying model (theory of acceptable decisions)  *   34 Simplification of decision-making  *   341 Anticipatory simplification  *   3411 Ideology  *   3412 Authority (organization)  *   3413 Rules  *   3414 Legal system  *   3415 Unplanned structures in the field of  decision-making  *   342 Techniques of decision-making  *   35 Organization of decision-making  At first glance this structure seems similar to the   rigid   structures. However  there are key differences that make it unique.  54   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution  in Early Modern Europe 53 (2016), 297.
285 TREE     First off, each has a numeric address between one and four digits long. As  Johannes Schmidt writes, “each of these subsections was assigned a numerical  prefix of up to four digits.” 55   Second, the numeric addresses are arbitrary.  They are   roughly   chosen. They are what are known as   fuzzy categories . Third,  each of them contain thoughts organized by numeric-alpha addresses which  then can branch down infinitely.  A practice I implement in my own Antinet centers on always using four-digits.  For instance, 3 General decision theory would be 3000 General decision  theory. Luhmann essentially omitted using zeros; however, for me, it makes  sense to employ them.  From each of the branches (or sub-branches), you can then begin   branching  down   and creating thoughts on stems under the sub-branches. Each of the  thoughts are   leaves   and represent a note. For instance, you’d create   3414/1 . This,  in turn, can then be branched down even further ( 3414/1/1 ), and on and on.  As one software developer who studied Luhmann’s archive puts it, “the ability  to branch was the central principle” in Luhmann’s system. 56   I wholeheartedly  agree with this assessment. The Antinet’s tree structure makes possible its  architecture. It enables it to contain   relations of relations of selective relations .  THE SCHEPERIAN TREE CLASSIFICATION  SYSTEM  The Luhmannian Tree Classification System bases its top-level branches  on an arbitrary decision. The creator of decides which branches to create  based on the project they intend to build with the system. For instance, in  Luhmann’s second Antinet, he chose top-level branches relevant to his  thirty-year-long undertaking of exploring the theory of society.  55   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

286      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  When I built my Antinet, I wanted it to encompass   all   domains of knowledge  so that I could move around wherever my interests went over my lifetime.  For this reason, I chose to base my classification system on the academic  disciplinary fields. The academic disciplinary fields provide a vast domain  for one to install their knowledge.  I surveyed various lists of the academic disciplines, including Stanford  University’s list of academic fields. 57   However, the most robust list I found  was Wikipedia’s list of academic disciplines. 58  I base my tree classification system (let’s call it the   Scheperian Tree Classifi -  cation System ) on this robust list.  Here are my top-level branches:  –   1000 – Arts & Humanities  –   2000 – Social Science  –   3000 – Natural Science  –   4000 – Formal Science  –   5000 – Applied Arts & Sciences  The branches are quite broad, and there is a wealth of sub-branches available  under each of them. The process entails searching the Wikipedia page of  the   Outline of Academic Disciplines   for a given field. From there, you simply  choose a number arbitrarily under the parent branch from which to build  out a subject area. Material related to life self-development and life philoso -  phy can be added to a section within Applied Arts & Sciences, for instance  (5411 – Self-Development).  Luhmann’s first Antinet focused on knowledge accumulation. It also focused  on generating interesting insights by way of   bisociation . His second Antinet,  57   Stanford Admitted Students, “Explore Disciplines,” Stanford Admitted Students, ac -  cessed March 31, 2022, https://admit.stanford.edu/departments-programs/.  58   “Outline of Academic Disciplines,” in Wikipedia, March 24, 2022, https://en.wikipedia.  org/w/index.php?title=Outlineofacademicdisciplines&oldid=1078952876.
287 TREE     however, was narrower in its focus. The entire thing really could be con -  sidered a branch of the sociology branch. It was primarily theory-focused.  By using the academic disciplinary fields as detailed previously, the top-level  branches can encompass the fields explored in both of Luhmann’s Antinets.  If he had started building his Antinet out using the academic disciplinary  fields as his classification system, there’s a good chance he wouldn’t have  needed to create a second Antinet.  CHOOSING YOUR OWN TREE CLASSIFICATION  According to John Locke, classifications are important for two reasons. First,  “it’s a great help to the memory.” Second, it allows us to “avoid confusion in  our thoughts.” In other words, it gives us a   map of reality , or as Locke calls  it, “a map as it were of the   mundus intelligibilis .” 59   Mundus intelligibilis   is the  Latin term for   intelligible world . Classification systems, in other words, create  a map of intelligible reality.  When building out the structure of your own Antinet, you’re left with several  options in choosing a classification system.  You can go the Luhmannian route and create a rough, arbitrary list of sec -  tions based on what you think you’ll need (like Luhmann’s second Antinet  containing eleven branches).  Or you can go the route of keeping things more open ended. This seems  to be the route Luhmann took with his first Antinet that contains 108  top-level branches.  Sometimes I’m presented with a question like   I’m a data scientist working  in the field of machine learning. Why should I adopt the academic disciplinary  fields as my classification system? Why do I have to include Arts & Humanities?  The simple answer is that you don’t! You don’t have to choose the academic  disciplinary field classification system. However, you’re potentially locking  yourself in for life to a small branch. You’re betting that you’ll be interested in  59   Richard Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices   (Brill, 2016), 148.

I chose the academic disciplines because  the system allows me to move around to whatever branch of knowledge  I wish to learn about in the future and build out that branch.  The choice is yours. There are many different classifications systems you  can gain inspiration from.  You can adopt John Locke’s structure: “ Physica , for medical and scientific  subjects, or   Ethica   for moral, philosophical, and political topics.” 60  There are numerous other classification systems to choose from.  Aristotle had his own classification system that categorized every aspect of  human understanding into ten categories: substance, quantity, quality, rela -  tion, place, time, position, state, action, and affection. 61   Francis Bacon had  his own classification system that was divided into (1)   divine learning , which  encompassed the timeless truth of scriptures, and (2)   human learning , which  encompassed history, poetry, philosophy, and other fields. 62   There’s also the  classification system of Charles Cutter—whose work at the Harvard College  library paved the way for the Library of Congress Classification System. 63  There’s even classification schemes organized by   space ,   time , and   objects . 64  There is also, of course, the Dewey Decimal Classification system, which  includes ten top-level classes:  60   Richard Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices   (Brill, 2016), 147.  61   Alex Wright, Cataloging the World: Paul Otlet and the Birth of the Information Age, 1st  edition (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), 27; Manuel Lima, The Book  of Trees: Visualizing Branches of Knowledge, Illustrated edition (New York: Princeton  Architectural Press, 2014), 44.  62   Alex Wright, Cataloging the World: Paul Otlet and the Birth of the Information Age, 1st  edition (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), 27-8.  63   Alex Wright, Cataloging the World: Paul Otlet and the Birth of the Information Age, 1st  edition (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), 37.  64   Alex Wright, Cataloging the World: Paul Otlet and the Birth of the Information Age, 1st  edition (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), 122, 183.

There’s no really good reason. It’s merely preference. I simply like Wikipedia’s  outline of academic disciplines better. I find it broader and also easier to  search. If you like the Dewey Decimal Classification System better, that’s  fine. Go with what you prefer. Because of the infinite internal branching, it  will adjust and evolve to fit your needs.  Remember, these classification systems merely serve as the trunk and  broad branches from which your tree of knowledge develops. The true  value derives from the many remote stems of thoughts and rich leaves that  develop around certain ideas. René Descartes recognized this as well: “It is  not from the roots or the trunks of trees that we gather the fruit, but only  from the extremities of their branches, so the principal utility of philosophy  depends on the separate uses of its parts, which we can only learn last of all.” 65  A more modern classification has emerged called the Johnny Decimal System.  It’s geared toward managing digital files. It seems we’re beginning to come  full circle in personal knowledge management. “Nobody can find anything  any more,” Johnny Decimal’s site declares. “Thousands of emails. Hundreds  of files.

We thought search would save us from this nightmare,  but we were wrong .” 66  I couldn’t agree more, yet I think the better solution is found in adopting an  analog system over digital, of course!  The bottom line is this: you have several classification system options to  choose from, though I’ll be teaching Wikipedia’s   Outline of Academic Dis -  ciplines   in this book. However, whatever system you choose, keep in mind  that the classification systems are a   rough   starting point. Because of the  tree structure of the Antinet, your system will evolve internally beyond  the classification scheme. Classification systems merely assist in creating   a  rough starting point   for a branch. They do not serve to encompass everything.  The reason you shouldn’t get too hung up the classification system is because  of the other component of the Antinet which will be covered next: the index.  When building out an Antinet, you’re creating a map for your thoughts,  which are   representations of reality . Classification systems help you create  a map of these representations of reality. Yet the index component of the  Antinet is a second layer map of your thoughts which enable you to navigate  freely across your Antinet without being held back by the limitations of  classification systems.

291 TREE     THE MYTHOLOGY OF TREES  When you begin using an Antinet, you’ll be sufficiently supplied with  practical knowledge of working with tree structures. Before you’re in the  thick of this terrain, however, I’d like to supply you with some metaphysical  knowledge of tree structures.  Trees are the core symbol of the most important stories ever told in both  Eastern and Western theological and philosophical systems. 68  In the West, the crucifixion of Jesus serves as perhaps the most widely-told  story in history. The story’s motifs, according to the scholar, Joseph Camp -  bell, center on life after death. This can be thought of as being resurrected  or creating a legacy out of one’s work.  Within this great story is that of Christ on the   holy rood . The holy rood is the  cross made out of a tree, referred to as the   tree of redemption . 69  From The Book of Genesis there’s the   tree of life   and the   tree of knowledge .  If you ever wondered why there’s evil in the world, here’s the answer: It’s  because of some damn woman named Eve! What did Eve do? She ate from  the   tree of knowledge .  In the West, the metaphorical importance of trees is not exclusively unique  to Christianity. The metaphorical significance of trees actually stems from  Jewish, Assyrian, and Sumerian traditions. 70  In the East, we have the foundational story of The Buddha’s enlightenment.  The motifs of this story center on the once-spoiled aristocrat-turned-ascetic  named Siddhartha Gautama. One day, when sitting beneath a bodhi tree (for  forty-nine days straight), young Siddhartha became enlightened.

292      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  in turn, became known as the   tree of enlightenment . The bodhi tree forms  the term and figure we know as Buddha. 71  Not only do we find trees as symbols in the most widely shared Eastern  and Western stories, we also see them in our modern mythic stories.   Harry  Potter   used his wand as a source of power. The Ents were the tree-people in  The Lord of The Rings, and in The Game of Thrones , we find   the heart tree, the  core symbol of Winterfell, as well as the Three-Eyed Raven, an old man who is  enfolded in a tree. 72  MORE RESOURCES ON TREES  It may seem rather absurd to be reading about trees in a book about a  knowledge system built entirely of notecards. However, there is more to  trees than meets the eye.  As I’ve shown you throughout this chapter, there’s applicable power within  tree structures and they serve as a fundamental component for how and  why the Antinet works so well.  I won’t go deeper into tree structures any more than I already have. However,  I’d like to leave you with a few resources that may be of interest:  1.   Ascoli, Giorgio A.

We’ve still got  another key component of the Antinet to explore: the index!  CONCLUSION  We’ve covered a lot in this chapter. You’ve learned about the   rough   tree  structure of the Antinet. You’ve been introduced to the deep theoretical  implications of the tree structure. We touched on the concepts of   order   and  chaos . We’ve explored the concept of   hierarchy , and how the Antinet is   not   a  traditional hierarchical structure (but is rather built on   association   and   prox -  imity ). I’ve taken you into the depths of classification systems. And finally,  I capped off this chapter with the mythological magic of trees.  This was a lot to cover. Thanks for sticking with me; I promise you’ll be  rewarded. You now have a deep theoretical knowledge of the Antinet. This  will come in handy in the long term. You’ll find yourself more confident in  the system because you know the rich depth in which its theory relies. You  won’t risk yet another instance in your life of getting excited about a new  system, only to find yourself quitting (and shifting to whatever the next  shiny, new object happens to be). The Antinet   is it . It’s the very best tool for
294      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  developing deep thought. It’s the best system for those who wish to become  a   learning machine , an   online content machine , a   book-writing machine , and an  academic research machine . Keep going.  In the next chapter, we’ll be diving into a more “practical” area of the Antinet:  the index. Press on.
295  C H A PT E R N I N E  �  INDEX  “ Considering the absence of a systematic order, we must regulate the process of  rediscovery of notes, for we cannot rely on our memory of numbers. The alternation  of numbers and alphabetic characters in numbering the notecards helps memory  and is an optical aid when we search for them, but it is insufficient. Therefore we  need a [index] of keywords that we constantly update. ”  –Niklas Luhmann,   Communication with Noteboxes 1  WHAT THE INDEX IS  I n the previous chapter , I touched on how classification systems pro -  vide utility in that they create a map of   intelligible reality . The tree, with its  organized branches of knowledge, proves useful for managing and perusing  your knowledge. Yet classification systems have their limits. They confine  information into silos and can be rather broad. Thankfully, the tree struc -  ture mitigates some of these downsides. Trees enable thoughts to flow and  they create stems into more specific areas for thoughts to evolve (over the  long term).  However, the tree structure is not enough. The tool that serves as a sec -  ond-layer map is the   index . The index enables one to jump around freely from  branch-to-branch, stem-to-stem, and leaf-to-leaf in one’s tree of knowledge.  The index transforms the system into something that looks like this:  1   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

296      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The   index   is composed of a special type of notecard containing two things:  (1) a   keyterm , and (2) a   location .  As mentioned earlier, a good way to think of the   location   component of the  index is to compare it to latitude and longitude coordinates (e.g., 37.2431° n ,  115.7930° w ). These can be thought of as the place’s   global address . 2   This is  why numeric-alpha addresses are   addresses , opposed to being IDs. But we  humans don’t think in coordinates, we think in keyterms.  THE KEYTERM  We humans don’t spend our time thinking and communicating in the  equivalent of latitude/longitude coordinates (“lat/long”). As Luhmann put  it, “we cannot rely on our memory of numbers.” 3   We need a human-friendly  2   “Understanding Latitude and Longitude,” accessed April 4, 2022, https://journeynorth.  org/tm/LongitudeIntro.html.  3   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

297 INDEX     name to be   associated   with the lat/long coordinates. We need a   key   in other  words, of a   term   to associate with the coordinates. This human-friendly   key  and   term   is what we call the   keyterm .  The keyterm is simply the name of anything your brain   naturally   uses to  describe the location of something. It can be anything. It can be a person,  place, thing, metaphorical concept, idea, or whatever— as long as it can be  noted down . 4  Why the keyterm? Well, I mean, we could try and remember the location  of something by memorizing   37.2431° n , 115.7930° w … or we could remember  it by associating it with its more human-friendly name:   Area 51 . I think it’s  pretty obvious that the keyterm   Area 51   is easier to remember.  With the keyterm,   Area 51 , we can pair it with a   value . We do this by plac -  ing a colon (:) between the keyterm and value. The format looks like this:  keyterm: ‘value’. For instance, Area 51: ‘37.2431° n , 115.7930° w ’. Within the  Antinet, the value is not a lat/long coordinate, but a numeric-alpha address  (i.e., Area 51: ‘2563/27 a ’).  In computer science terminology, this is a type of data structure. It’s a   key-  value pair . It’s known more familiarly as a   map   or an   associative array .  I like the term   associative array , so let’s roll with that. A thesaurus is similar  to an associative array. Like a thesaurus, which contains multiple synonyms  for a word, you can have multiple values for a keyterm. For instance, Area  51: ‘2563/27 a ’, ‘5472/3’, ‘3572/22/1/4). In computer-science geek-speak, this  is known as a   multimap ,   multihash , or   multidict .

298      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  THE PURPOSE OF THE INDEX  A system relying on complete random chance (with no index and no tree  structure) is an undesirable system. It costs more (effort) than it produces.  Yet a system of too much order is lifeless and yields a lower probability of  generating breakthrough insights. The perfect middle ground is to have a  system that employs an organic tree structure that allows both order and  chaos to emerge. The perfect mediator to navigate between order and chaos  is the index. This is its single, simple purpose. 5   It’s there to provide you with  at least one point of entry into your tree of knowledge related to any given  keyterm. 6   This allows you to begin stumbling upon other leaves of thought,  as well as other stems and branches that have since formed around the term.  Luhmann did not create an exhaustive list of cardlinks for each keyterm.  Just because card 5248/3 mentions   complexity , doesn’t mean the indexed  keyterm for   complexity   gets a cardlink pointing to 5248/3. Why? Because  mentions don’t matter. What matters is that the card address to which the  complexity   keyterm points   actually significantly pertains to the concept itself .  Mentions don’t matter much. This makes the index more useful than search.  When you search your notes digitally, all sorts of irrelevant mentions show  up for the search term. This is not so with the index.  The reason Luhmann   did not   create cardlinks for every single card mention -  ing a keyterm is not because it is technically unfeasible (I mean it is, but it’s  something that Luhmann wouldn’t have preferred even if he possessed the  capability). Rather, the reason Luhmann only included a few cardlinks per  keyterm can be distilled down to two reasons:  1.   The tree structure of the Antinet allows you to follow the stems of thought  the notecard rests on. This then takes you on a journey that reveals more  cards related to the concept. It then may take you to a   collective   card. This  5   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

299 INDEX     is a card containing a collection of cardlinks to other areas of your Antinet  (you’ll learn more about collectives later).  2 . By creating only a general list of a few cardlinks, it affirms the   rough   tree  structure of the Antinet. It re-emphasizes the expectation that the location  provides you with a   rough   area of your Antinet. It enables your present  conscious mind to interact and communicate with your Antinet. You  encounter nearby stems of thoughts in the area that surprise you. When  such a communication takes place, breakthrough insights occur which  have come about by complete accident. The power of this communication  experience will be detailed later in the book.  The reason there are but a few cardlinks for each keyterm entry is that it sets  you on a path of exploration. It enables you to explore your tree of knowl -  edge. This also highlights another downside of digital systems. Lacking the  nested tree-like structures of the Antinet, digital systems are just a flat-level  view of connected bubbles. This knowledge work, however, is not just about  storing information and creating cool bubble graphs; it’s about   exploration .  The tree structure of the Antinet enables meaningful exploration. As Alberto  Cevolini writes, “secondary memories themselves have an inner order that  allows for   exploration .” 7  The Antinet is a long-term storage container of your short-term store of  thoughts. In itself, it’s a single storage of your mind’s thoughts. It transforms  your short-term memory and long-term memory into one holistic entity  (a second mind). The index is a secondary storage container which allows  you to navigate your second mind.  It took a long time for humans to realize that you could create a secondary  container (that is, a secondary map) for exploring your own knowledge.  It wasn’t until the latter half of the sixteenth century that scholars realized  7   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016), 16.  Emphasis added.
300      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  the index could be used as a secondary data storage for navigating the main  memory store. 8  Luhmann was sage in not overlooking the rather new technology of the index.  Inspired by The Royal Society of London, Luhmann created his own index,  which he called a   register . In specific notes in his Antinet, Luhmann mentions  having paid attention to how the Royal Society developed their register of  knowledge. 9   Like Johannes Schmidt, though, I prefer the term   index   to refer  to Luhmann’s register. You’re welcome to use whichever terminology you  prefer. Heck, in the beginning I used to refer to it as the   map . Yet the name  that’s stuck for me is index, and that’s what I shall use from here on.  THE POWER OF THE INDEX  As the scholar who has studied Luhmann’s Antinet most closely, Johannes  Schmidt, deems the index “a central key to the system.” 10   The elimination of  a fixed classification system and the lack of table of contents turn the index  into a “key tool” for using the file. As Schmidt puts it, “how else should  one be able to find certain notes again and thus gain access to the system of  references?” 11   In brief, the index is a critical component in using an Antinet.  The index is the conduit by which your brain “structurally couples” itself  to the thoughts compiled into an inanimate box. It is the component that  breathes life into the Antinet, thereby creating a second mind, an alter ego  with which you can communicate.  This isn’t woo-woo fuzzy jargon; it’s backed by knowledge science. “Memory  lies not in the machine,” says the scholar, Alberto Cevolini, “but the structural  8   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016), 9.  9   “ZK II: Slip 9/8h - Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed April 1, 2022,   https://niklas-luh -  mann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8h_V .  10   Undisciplined, Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt, 2021, https://www.youtube.  com/watch?v=kz2K3auPLWU, 41:48.  11   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

301 INDEX     coupling of users and machines, that is, in the indexing system.” 12   Indeed, the  index stands as the core property which transitions the Antinet from merely  a container of   others’   thoughts, into “an actual writing generator,” observes  the scholar Élisabeth Décultot. 13  CUED RECALL  Cued recall is the modern cognitive scientific term for the no-longer-favored  term   recollection . It occurs when a stimulus (for example a word, sound,  or image) elicits a memory of another item with which it is linked. 14   Basically,  cued recall works by invoking a memory when presented with a keyterm  as the prompt.  When you create a deliberate, hand-written keyterm entry in your index,  you are neuroimprinting a   cue   into your mind.  Let’s take an example. Say you’ve read Cal Newport’s book,   So Good They  Can’t Ignore You . A key idea in that book revolves around something called  deliberate practice . Deliberate practice is setting aside a deliberately planned  time to practice a skill—regardless of whether the activity is enjoyable  (oftentimes, it isn’t). 15   In the context of the Antinet, if you’re interested in  this particular concept, you would undertake a time-intensive process. First  you would write down the idea on the bibcard related to Newport’s book.  After that, you would create a maincard for the idea. On the maincard you  would either excerpt the idea (by writing down a quote by hand), reformu -  late the idea (by summarizing it in your own words), or reflect on the idea  (by adding your own take, experience, and thoughts on the idea). After this  phase, you would then create a keyterm of the idea, consolidating it into a  brief word or phrase.  12   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016), 32.  13   Élisabeth Décultot, The Art of Excerpting in the Eighteenth Century Literature:  Subversion and Continuity of an Old Scholarly Practice (Brill, 2016), 122.  14   Richard Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices   (Brill, 2016), 134.  15   “Deliberate Practice—an Overview | ScienceDirect Topics,” accessed April 1, 2022, https://  www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/deliberate-practice.
302      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Whenever you begin reading a new book and you come across an idea  that relates to   deliberate practice , you can recall that you already have a  keyterm in your Antinet that elaborates on this area. From there, you may  either, (1) recall what you already know about   deliberate practice   (thanks to  neuroimprinting you can remember what you already know), and (2) you  can simply write down the term   deliberate practice   and the page number  on the new bibcard. From there you can refer to your Antinet and explore  the branches and stems of what you already know about   deliberate practice .  At that point you can develop the thought further by creating a dedicated  maincard for it. If you don’t feel it is necessary to develop a maincard, you  can simply write down the external reference of the book and page number  (thereby letting the idea   ruminate ).  In brief, because you’ve been intentional in creating a keyterm for an idea,  you begin to read differently. While reading, when you come across ideas  and concepts related to   deliberate practice , you develop a greater capability  to do several things:  1.   While reading, the concept you recall may be deemed important enough  that you decide to   extract   a new relevant bit of information. As mentioned  previously, you may either (1) excerpt it, (2) reformulate it, or (3) elab -  orate on it.  2.   You’ve deliberately   primed   your mind, and have   selected   the idea of  deliberate practice   as important. Because you’ve intentionally created a  keyterm for the idea, and since you have installed the concept in your  Antinet, you may recall the concepts related to it. This is made possible,  thanks to the tree structure. You can begin to piece together concepts  related to it.  3.   Another benefit is that since you   know   you’ve written something valu -  able about the keyterm already, you are more motivated to review what  you’ve already written about the concept in your Antinet. I often find  myself surprised when I review keyterms. I recall key ideas I’ve long  forgotten about.
303 INDEX     DELIBERATE INDEXING IS DIFFERENT  FROM TAGGING  As others have observed, so-called “rigid folders” have fallen out of fashion  in the modern personal-knowledge-management field. The new popular  practice revolves around creating tags (that is,   tagging   notes). 16  Digital Zettelkasten practitioners may learn of Luhmann’s index and delib -  erate keyterms, and then liken the process to that of tagging notes. They  may then proceed to tag every single one of their notes.  There’s a difference, however, in how Luhmann used his Antinet. His keyterms  served as an entry point into his tree of knowledge (and its branches and  stems of thought). Keyterms were used sparingly to get you started on the  path of exploring your notes organically by way of exploration. However, as  has been observed, tagging is not so central and it’s not   intensely necessary  that every note needs to be tagged. 17  Furthermore, when you tag your notes using digital Zettelkasten tools, it’s  possible to   over-tag   notes. It naturally follows that it thereby “cheapens” the  individual tag. A note with a powerful idea about   truth   is lumped together  with other notes tagged with   truth —even ideas vaguely relating to the con -  cept of   truth . With digital systems that enable easy and low-cost information  collection, the bad ends up drowning out the good.  To understand the different nature of the index system vs. digital tagging,  the following diagram helps illustrate the nature of the two:  16   “ Luhmanns   Arbeitsweise   Im   Elektronischen   Zettelkasten,"   Strenge   Jacke!

304      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Tagging misses out on the unique branching structure of notes. It results  in flat, weak relations and bubble graphs. Because of the tendency to tag  anything and everything, a bunch of weak connections and useless material  also becomes linked together. Essentially, the tendency to tag every note  creates an information swamp. Tagging embodies the typical structure of  digital Zettelkasten systems. It creates a pile of leaves on the ground with  vines connecting weakly-associated leaves together.  A GUIDE TO THE INDEX  There are three boxes in the Antinet: (1) the bibliography box (the “bib  box”), (2) the main box of the Antinet storing thoughts by concept in the  numeric-alpha tree structure (the “main box”), and (3) the index box con -  taining keyterms that point one to locations in the Antinet (the “index box”).  The index box contains a list of alphabetized cards. There are two types of  cards in the index: (1) List Indexcards, and (2) Keyterm Indexcards. Let’s  cover these now.  LIST INDEXCARDS  List indexcards   are cards filed alphabetically, each pertaining to one letter of
305 INDEX     the alphabet ( A ,   B ,   C , etc.). Under the assigned alphabetical character is a  list of keyterms that begin with the letter affixed to the card.  These cards serve as an   associative array   of key-value pairs. The key is the  keyterm, and the value is the address of a card in the main box of the Antinet.  When you first start out building your Antinet, you should begin by creating  26 list indexcards (one for each letter in the alphabet).  Examples of List Indexcards  The following list indexcard is from Luhmann (it’s a Luhmannian list  indexcard):  photo credit : “ZK I: Note in the Subject Index (002-A)—Niklas  Luhmann Archive,” accessed April 1, 2022, https://niklas-luhmann-  archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_SW1_002_V.  You’ll notice a few things from the card. First, there is a red letter   A   in the  top left corner. This signifies that these are keyterms beginning with   A . The
306      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  second thing you’ll notice is that the keyterms in the list   are not   alphabetical.  For instance, Argument comes before Aggressivität. The list of keyterms  accumulates over time, organically, and in an emergent fashion. The words  are organized temporally (by time). The only requirement is that they begin  with the letter A.  Here is a list indexcard from my own Antinet (a Scheperian list indexcard):  You’ll notice a few differences in my own version. First, you’ll see there’s a  convention with arrows. For instance Contradictions → Polarity. This tells  me to navigate to the Polarity keyterm in my index box. The second thing  you’ll notice are conventions like SA: ‘1805/9’. SA means   See Also . Third,  you’ll see that the top of the card reads C (2). This tells me that it’s the  second list indexcard for the letter C. Fourth, you’ll notice that I cross out  certain keyterm entries. For instance Change (Formula For)…is crossed  out. This tells me to go see the dedicated   keyterm indexcard , which you’ll  learn about next.  KEYTERM INDEXCARDS  A keyterm indexcard, as opposed to a list indexcard, is a dedicated card
307 INDEX     listing multiple links or external references for a given keyterm. Whenever  a keyterm entry in a list indexcard accumulates multiple cardlinks, you’ll  want to create a dedicated keyterm indexcard for it.  Here’s an example of a keyterm indexcard:  This keyterm indexcard is for the keyterm Change. It displays the crossed-  out entries from the list, such as Formula For: ‘5409/0’, which becomes  Formula for Change ; and the listed keyterm and Business; ‘5100/1’ becomes  Change and Business . The entry State      ‘State’ refers to   changing state (as in  changing one’s state of mind), and the arrow prompts me to go see the dedicated  keyterm indexcard ‘State.’  THE INDEX BOX  Within the index box, the indexcards should be organized alphabetically. The  list indexcards are placed immediately after the letter-dividers, followed by the  keyterm indexcards. Each of the following keyterm indexcards starting with  the same letter should then be organized alphabetically relative to each other.  To illustrate, on the following page is a picture of my index box. Behind the  A divider, you’ll first encounter the A (1) list indexcard (note that the yellow  A (4) card is visible in this photo).
308      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN
309 INDEX     Here is another photo. Likewise, the C (1) list indexcard follows the letter C  divider; here there are several more list indexcards, which ends with C (4).
310      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Immediately behind C (4) the sequence of my keyterm indexcards begins.  The first keyterm indexcard is Candor (Candidness).
311 INDEX     Following this card, is the next card in the alphabetical list: Categorization.
312      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  This gives you a good practical taste of the components involved in building  out an index.  SEARCH IS A BUG, NOT A FEATURE  When you use the index component of the Antinet to search, you’re   exploring .  When you search notes digitally, the internal dialogue is different. You’re  not so much exploring as you are   filtering . In essence, you are simply trying  to recognize and sift through signals. Oftentimes, you spend a great deal of  time sifting through keywords that show up in the search results.  Many people who have written about (digital) Zettelkasten miss the fact that  search is a bug, and not a feature . Why? Perhaps it stems from the perennial  human tendency of not recognizing and questioning inaccurate assumptions.  A significant portion of the book   Thinkertoys , a book focused on improving  thinking, centers on challenging assumptions. 18   It’s simply difficult and  hard work to   invert   and challenge all of your assumptions all the time. It’s  exhausting. It’s no surprise that many digital Zettelkasten practitioners  have never stopped to actually question the value of search since we live  in the GAMA era: Google, Apple, Meta (Facebook), and Amazon. In this  GAMA era, we have a collective bias and acceptance of digital search being  a desired feature in all cases.  The assumption that the search function is a universally desirable feature is  what plagues digital Zettelkasten systems. For instance, one author declares  digital systems to be better because they “allow you to search whole data -  bases.” 19   Yet digital search possesses a wealth of insidious negative effects  that are difficult to spot with the naked eye. The downsides of such a system  become apparent   only after   investing significant time and energy creating a  large enough note database in the first place.  18   Michael Michalko, Thinkertoys: A Handbook of Creative-Thinking Techniques, Revised  edition (Berkeley, Calif: Ten Speed Press, 2006).  19   David Kadavy, Digital Zettelkasten: Principles, Methods, & Examples (Kadavy, Inc.,  2022), 17.
313 INDEX     As Alberto Cevolini points out, digital search is disappointing for at least  two reasons.  The first reason is that search results are “too large.” 20   With a digital note -  taking app this quickly becomes obvious, and it only gets worse over time.  Unfortunately, by the time things get unbearable, you’re faced with a mas -  sive number of notes. The   sunk-cost dilemma   (sticking with a system that is  ineffective just because you’ve invested so much time and energy in building  that system) is a real problem.  Having an app that indexes every single word of your thoughts ends up  drowning out the attention you would otherwise spend creating deliberate  and carefully selected keyterms.  The second reason digital search is disappointing echoes this issue. “The  complete number of results,” Cevolini writes, “is never a reliable pan -  orama of what is actually stored in secondary memory and it is not  necessarily informative.” 21  The cognitive psychologist and bestselling author Steven Pinker, provides an  observation backing this notion. In an “optimally designed” information and  knowledge system like the Antinet, search results should only yield items  where “the relevance of the item outweighs the cost of retrieving it.” 22   The  problem with digital systems, however, is that the cost of retrieval is so low  that it yields information and knowledge that is of low relevance and low  value. I contend that the Antinet does not suffer the same effect.  Although it seems counter-intuitive, human-domain experts outperform  search algorithms even today. Take this illustration from Pinker:  20   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016), 33.  21   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2016), 33.  22   Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works, Norton pbk (New York: Norton, 2009), 142.
314      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Anyone who has used a computerized library retrieval system  quickly comes to rue the avalanche of titles spilling across the  screen. A human expert, despite our allegedly feeble powers  of retrieval, vastly outperforms any computer in locating a  piece of information from its content. When I need to find  articles in a topic in an unfamiliar field, I don’t use the library  computer; I send an email to a pal in the field. 23  This is something also observed by computer science professor and bestselling  author, Cal Newport. He advises his readers to talk to reference librarians.  “I’m amazed by how often this resource is overlooked,” Newport writes.  “Ask the librarian for research help and she will guide you to some amazing  sources you would have never found on your own. These extra discoveries  make the difference between an average paper and one that shines.” 24  ANTINET SEARCH EQUALS EXPLORATION;  DIGITAL SEARCH EQUALS FILTERING  IRRELEVANT INFORMATION  When you are trying to find something in your Antinet, think of it like Tarzan  swinging through trees. He swings from branch to branch and then along  stems and leaves of thought. Every time you swing to a different branch  by way of vines (links), you trigger a   reverberation   event. You’re reminding  yourself not just of the idea, but of the area and stems of thought around  the idea. This experience is lost via digital search. You’re presented with a  plethora of useless information. With the Antinet, you’re engaged in the  experience of jumping from branch to branch through your knowledge. With  digital search, you’re not even in the jungle. You’re in a dim office somewhere  reading about the jungle through a computer screen.  23   Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works, Norton pbk (New York: Norton, 2009), 142.  24   “Monday Master Class: The Most Important Paper Research Advice You’ve Never Heard  —Study Hacks—Cal Newport,” accessed April 11, 2022, https://www.calnewport.com/  blog/2007/12/17/monday-master-class-the-most-important-paper-research-advice-  youve-never-heard/.
315 INDEX     The Antinet allows you to experience the power of   exploration . It promotes a  way of exploring that is curious, deliberate, and that operates within a general  and rough context. This is akin to the experience of being in a library and  exploring shelved books. Oftentimes, you happen upon profoundly valu -  able books by way of   accidental discovery just by   walking down a row in the  library that interests you—even if it’s somewhat unrelated to your current  project. In doing this, you may stumble upon a book that becomes a critical  component of the project or book you’re working on. Digitally searching  your notes eliminates this magical experience.  The digital Zettelkasten proselytizers oftentimes think that   linking   is the core  component of Zettelkasten systems. This couldn’t be further from the truth.  An entire industry of apps and courses revolve around the idea of linking notes.  Yet linking does is not the core component of Zettelkasten systems. It is but  one property, along with indexing and others, that makes the system work.  For instance, the analog nature of the Antinet makes full-text search impos -  sible. It forces users to   explicitly create   very selective links between thoughts.  Why? Because you know there’s no full-text search that possesses the illusion  of saving you later on.   When you’re writing out a note by hand, and you think  of a related note, you must create the link right then and there . There’s no safety  net. Laziness, in other words, is not an option.  As a result, you invest more energy in creating very selective links. You end  up hardcoding cardlinks into your notes with the result that you end up  taking them more seriously than you would cheaply created digital wikilinks.  After investing that energy, it’s more likely that you will follow the cardlinks  and   explore   your notes, which then takes you to new places in your Antinet  where you might stumble upon other information that would lead to more  accidental breakthrough insights.  THE BUGS OF DIGITAL SEARCH  Digital Search Robs You of Maintenance  Rehearsal Learning and Association  Manually flipping through your old notes and reviewing them strengths your
316      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  long-term memory; it gives more opportunities for   maintenance rehearsal  (talked about in detail in this book).  Searching your Antinet relates to the process of reviewing flash cards for an  exam. Yet it’s not painfully boring like   rote learning   usually is. Rote learning  is a memorization technique based on repetition—it’s essentially   main -  tenance rehearsal   that allows you to keep an idea fresh in your mind, then  refresh it when your memory lags. Yet, with the Antinet, it’s a different flavor  of maintenance rehearsal. While you’re reviewing your old ideas, you’re  oftentimes holding a new card idea in your mind. Why? Because you’re on  a quest to install a new idea that you’re probably excited about into your  Antinet. The name of the game is similarity. You’re on a quest, looking for  the most similar idea to install this card next to. This entire quest is a fun  process, it even improves mood, which I’ll detail shortly. In brief, digital  search lacks such a process.  By using a digital Zettelkasten, you thwart the richness of the process of  inducing maintenance rehearsal while searching for the most-closely asso -  ciated idea in the Antinet.  Digital Search Kills the Magic  of Structured Accidents  When perusing a library,   structured accidents   often occur. The accidental  discovery of an incredible book is not a completely random accident, it’s  a structured accident. After all, the book is contained within a structured  contextual area of the library. It’s not completely random.  The magic of the Antinet is not only in how it fosters your thinking of and  associating the new concept from the book you’ve read with what it relates  to (that’s a conventional interaction). Rather, the magic of the Antinet  comes from discoveries “which were never planned, never preconceived,  or conceived.” 25   Important discoveries come about not so much by way of  your current thinking; they come about by realizing the magical connections  25   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans. Manfred  Kuehn, https://daily.scottscheper.com/zettelkasten/.
317 INDEX     you first missed in your old way of thinking. They also come about by way  of   structured accidents .  The power of   accidents   will be covered later in this book, however, let’s take  a look at a few examples.  The following is an example of a more conventional interaction that reveals  somewhat interesting insights.  Here’s the keyterm indexcard for Association.  There’s one curious entry there written as Fallacy of: (Persian Messenger):  ‘2432/4’. This pertains to the   Persian-messenger   fallacy commonly known  as   shooting the messenger   who bears, and is thus associated with, bad news.  Because   association   is at the core of the fallacy, the keyterm points me to  this area of my Antinet.  This type of thing often occurs in digital search. This, however, is not an  unconventional insight. Nor is it something that necessarily produces  breakthrough creative insights.
318      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Breakthrough insights come about by way of unconventional interactions.  They come about by way of   structured accidents . This is why it’s critical,  in Luhmann’s words, that your “selection and comparisons are not identical  with the schema of searching for them.” 26   Simply searching for a keyword  robs the potential for innovation to occur. You are only presented with  information you feel is related at the time. Ingenious insights come from  unconventional   discoveries you make along the way. The breakthrough ideas  that come from flipping through your related past thoughts,   in a structured  way , are what unlock truly unconventional interactions. The tree structure  of the Antinet induces these structured accidents.  While the   Persian messenger association fallacy   introduces an interesting  interaction, the more compelling ones come about by exploring the items  around the area where the concept resides (in this case, exploring around  2432/4). The truly unconventional interactions come about when navigating  through and around the tree structure of the Antinet.  Structured accidents are critical for procuring breakthrough insights. The  random pieces of information you encounter in your quest of exploring  the Antinet create valuable opportunities to experience incidental learning  (by way of structured accidents). 27   Digital search mitigates such phenomena  from occurring.  Digital Search Robs You of Developing a  Unique Structure for Evolving Your Mind  The Antinet’s structure allowed Luhmann to store deeply complex and inter -  connected information, thanks to its tree structure. It allowed him to grace -  fully navigate his mind and his memory (past and present).  26   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

319 INDEX     As has been mentioned before, developing his mind and memory came  about from two processes. It occurred first by neuroimprinting thoughts  by writing by hand. Second, by   engaging in an ongoing process of tending to  his file , Luhmann engaged in constant maintenance rehearsal, eventually  developing the ability to recall thoughts without effort. 28  When you instead review your own thoughts, written in your own hand -  writing, the process is often very fun. It’s also very humbling. You see your  thoughts and brilliant ideas written on cards from years ago. It also helps  mitigate the sense that you haven’t written something. When you see your  own handwriting with your own brilliant ideas, you experience a sense  of being impressed by your old self! More pertinent, this process builds  your memory. It builds it in such a way wherein your thoughts are primed  to compound.  With digital search, you’re constantly searching for and through documents  without any life or personality. They contain your thoughts, yes. But they’re  in some system-standardized font; the files are not living. They’re constantly  changing, being deleted, and overwritten. You have no chance to view the  changes in your thinking because all traces are erased.  Digital Search Robs You of a Positive Mood  Finally!

320      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  associative processing promotes positive mood.” 29   Every single thought in  the Antinet can only be installed by embarking upon an associative process.  Every new idea, every new thought, every new extension of thought comes  by way of exploring your tree of knowledge (which is a chain-linked set of  associations). You then aim to associate any new idea with the concept that  most closely resembles the chain of ideas already installed in the Antinet.  The Antinet improves mood, whereas digital search eradicates much of the  magic inherent in associative processing. Finally! We have proof. Digital  search robs you of a good mood. Digital search worsens your quality of life.  If you want a better life, as counterintuitive as it sounds, go analog!  CONCLUSION  In this chapter, we moved through some very important concepts. And we  moved through these in rather swift fashion (compared to the previous set  of chapters)! We covered the theoretical structure of the index. You learned  about the two types of indexcards. You learned how the index box works,  and saw several examples. You also learned the truth about digital search:  it’s a bug, not a feature. Last, we capped off this chapter by covering the  negatives of digital search.  The next chapter is very brief, it’s the “net” in the Antinet. Keep reading.

321  C H A PT E R T E N  �  NETWORK  I n 1956, on a gray evening   in the padded cell of a mental hospital,  W. Ross Ashby sat at his desk. He was putting the finishing touches on  his manuscript   Introduction to Cybernetics . Ashby was not a patient of the  mental hospital, however. He was a trained psychiatrist, research patholo -  gist, and at the time, was serving as the Director of Research at Barnwood  House Hospital in Gloucester, England. 30   He simply found the padded cells  of his patients to be the perfect environment to focus. In this padded cell  he published a paper which would greatly influence some of the brightest  thinkers in information theory, mathematics, and technology for decades  to come.  Ashby was always up to some odd research project. A few years prior,  he built what may be the first device in history capable of adapting itself to  its environment: the homeostat. For that work, Ashby’s wife proffered their  kitchen table as the workbench for his experiments that, in the homeostat’s  case, included Royal Air Force bomb parts. 31  From this experience Ashby devised his theory of cybernetics.  30 William Ross Ashby and Roger Conant,   Mechanisms of Intelligence: Ross Ashby’s Writings  on Cybernetics   (Seaside, Calif.: Intersystems Publications, 1981), preface.  31   Ashby and Conant,   Mechanisms of Intelligence , preface.
322      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  THE CYBERNETIC NETWORK  OF THE ANTINET  On the very first notecard Niklas Luhmann wrote down in preparation  for describing the Antinet Zettelkasten, he wrote that it’s a   cybernetic   sys -  tem. 32   We also know that Luhmann was familiar with the work of W. Ross  Ashby because we find Luhmann writing of Ashby’s work a few cards later. 33  We also know that Luhmann was deeply familiar with a subfield of cyber -  netics called   autopoiesis   (which is the concept of a system producing and  maintaining itself by creating itself).  Cybernetics derives from   kybernetes   (Greek), meaning “steersman,” and  refers to having a   goal   and achieving the goal through steering in the proper  direction by way of the communication of   feedback . W. Ross Ashby defines  it as “the art of steersmanship.” 34   One of the pioneers of cybernetics, Nor -  bert Wiener, characterizes it as “control and communication in animal and  machine.” 35   It arose as a disciplinary field involving information theory,  engineering, and computer science, and continues to have a wide-spanning  range across many different disciplinary fields.  Luhmann’s reference to the structure of his Antinet as a   cybernetic   one  makes sense. This field of study centers on   communication . It’s no accident  that Luhmann titled his paper on the Antinet,   Communication with Note -  boxes . The communication process arises out of the cybernetic nature of the  Antinet, utilizing   control   (by way of a fixed goal), and   feedback . Cybernetic  systems are modeled in both machines and living organisms. In the former,  such systems are closely related to machine learning, specifically Q-learning  (which artificial intelligence systems use to learn by way of reinforcement).  32   “ZK II: Note 9/8—Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed August 13, 2021,   https://niklas-luh -  mann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8_V .  33   “ZK II: Sheet 9/8b—Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed March 17, 2022,   https://niklas-  luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8b_V .  34   W.

323 NETWORK     THE NATURE OF THE ANTINET’S  CYBERNETIC NETWORK  The cybernetic network structure of the Antinet resembles that of   asso -  ciationism . 36   This involves the association of nodes in a network based  on   contiguity   (the continuous flow of thought), and on the   similarity   of  thoughts causing them to be grouped or linked to one another. These two  components ( contiguity   and   similarity ) are what govern   thought . They’re  also what comprise the structure of the cybernetic network of the Antinet.  In essence, the Antinet is built on associations that are linked together by  way of contiguity, in that continuously flowing ideas that overflow across  cards are naturally grouped together.  Additionally, the Antinet groups ideas in the long term by way of similarity.  The most similar thoughts are naturally grouped together, near one another.  The reason for this is that, again, the name of the game is to install notecards  closest to their nearest neighbors. This means either an individual notecard,  or a new stream of thought that encompasses several notecards which  elaborate on an idea.  The cards’ numeric-alpha addresses transform the Antinet’s network into  something akin to   auto-associators   in human memory science. This is some -  thing I go into in the chapter on how the Antinet mirrors human memory.  In brief, an auto-associator is built on content-addressable memory. 37   That  is, every single memory has an address “affixed” to it.  The Antinet’s network is essentially composed of individual units of con -  tent-addressable memory (thanks to numeric-alpha addresses). How one  navigates the network comes by way of the index and tree structure of the  Antinet. These two components enrich the network in a powerful way that  is absent in digital Zettelkasten systems.  36   Steven Pinker,   How the Mind Works   (New York: Norton, 2009), 113.  37   Pinker,   How the Mind Works , 104.
324      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  WHAT CREATES THE CYBERNETIC NETWORK  OF THE ANTINET  As already discussed, the Antinet’s numeric-alpha addresses “ensure utmost  autonomy, i.e. self-referential closure of the machine.” 38   The   self-referential  closure   of the machine is critical because it serves as the precondition for  creating a   cybernetic   network. In brief, the numeric-alpha addresses create  the cybernetic network of the Antinet.  This is important because the cybernetic nature of the Antinet is what helps  convert it into a network that provides   feedback . The problem with digital  Zettelkasten and many notetaking systems is that they lack feedback mech -  anisms. With an Antinet, however, the system is enclosed in feedback loops.  For example, in your mind you might be looking for an idea or concept. You  follow a train of thought, and if you can’t find what you’re looking for, that  is a piece of feedback. The feedback is even more valuable if you’re sure that  you have the idea stored somewhere in the Antinet. You’re forced to have a  conversation and to communicate with the Antinet. You ask yourself,   Where  else could I have stored the thought I’m looking for? What else is it related to?  In searching for the idea, you’re provided with more feedback and you make  accidental discoveries. The whole system is a feedback-generating mechanism  that brings unexpected new insights to the surface along the way.  CONCLUSION  This chapter is of briefer nature than the others, yet it’s no less important.  Now you know the nature of the network that characterizes the Antinet:  a cybernetic network.  Now we turn to a chapter of more practical nature. In the next chapter you’ll  be guided through the wild world of building your own Antinet. The first part  of the chapter serves as mental preparation in approaching the journey. Then,  halfway through the next chapter, you’ll be asked to follow a set of guided  instructions. Follow them precisely as I outline. Good luck, and Godspeed.  38   Alberto Cevolini, ed.,   Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe , Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 28.
325  C H A PT E R E L E V E N  �  THE HITCHHIKER’S GUIDE  TO THE ANTINET  A t this point you have more   than enough theoretical Antinet knowl -  edge. It’s time to roll up your sleeves and build out your own Antinet.  For all of the theoretical material you’ve ingested, you’ll be surprised to find  its nature to be quite simple.  THE OBSTACLES YOU’LL FACE BUILDING  AN ANTINET  Before we dive into the instructions, it’s critical for you to understand what  to expect. I’ve found that the biggest thing preventing anyone from building  out an Antinet is the false belief in what to expect. We’re going to dive into  this area now.  HOW TO EVEN BEGIN  The biggest obstacle you’ll face in building an Antinet is grasping how to  even begin in the first place. At this phase you might think that how you set  up your Antinet is critically important to its success. You might have the  feeling that if you make a single mistake in the beginning, the whole system  is doomed. Forever. Unfortunately, this is the case. Just kidding!  I’ve seen advice in online forums dedicated to digital Zettelkasten telling  people to   just begin   blindly, even randomly. You’ll also get advice from the  bestselling books that the Zettelkasten just emerges without planning—  without trying to create some semblance of organization using categories.
326      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  For instance, you’ll find authors stating things like: “The trick is that [Luh -  mann] did not organize his notes by topic, but in a rather abstract way of  giving them fixed numbers.” 39   Yet, as you learn throughout this book, this  notion is false. Luhmann never declared that anyone should start building  an Antinet with no idea at all of where they want to go. Luhmann’s second  Zettelkasten was planned with eleven   fuzzy categories . Luhmann’s first  Zettelkasten included 108 top-level categories. Both are included in the  appendix of this book.  Luhmann’s Antinet categories weren’t undetermined; rather, many were  predetermined . As Johannes Schmidt observes, “The pattern that we see here  is very much one of exploring and reflecting on largely predetermined, fairly  detailed fields of knowledge.” 40  In brief, you don’t want to start with zero idea of how you’d like to structure  your Antinet. Ideally, you want to start with a   rough   idea of where you want  to take it. You want a fuzzy idea of what you want to build. With that said, the  system I’m about to teach you makes use of well-developed disciplinary fields,  so even if you don’t have a clue about what you want to use your Antinet for,  it will still work for you in the long term. The expansive disciplinary fields,  plus the internal branching structure of the Antinet, enable the system to  evolve in whatever direction your mind wishes to take it.  I realize all this sounds rather abstract and ambiguous; however, once you  complete the instructions I’m about to provide, you’ll begin to see what I’m  talking about. Once you spend a few weeks using the system, you’ll get a  lot more comfortable with it, and you will be less likely to wonder if you’ve  done something wrong.  39   Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing,  Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers (North  Charleston, SC: CreateSpace, 2017), 19.  40   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

327 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     AVOID PERFECTIONISM (ALWAYS EVOLVE,  NEVER DELETE)  At the core of what I’ve just talked about is the tendency of perfectionism.  In the beginning of building your Antinet, you must abandon your desire  for perfection. One of the most valuable parts of the Antinet is… mistakes !  Specifically, your mistakes, your own thinking mistakes, and even imper -  fections in your own numbering conventions of the Antinet.  For instance, in the card I’m using to compose the section you’re reading  right now, I created what could be called an imperfection in its  numbering convention.  As you can see from this card, the card address is 4214/5 aca /1. You’ll notice  that the end part is in green ( a /1), whereas the beginning of the card address  is in blue. This is because at the time I created the card I hadn’t yet figured  out where I was going to put it. Therefore, in the beginning I would just  write   a /1 in green, and once I figured out where to install it, I’d prepend the  address with the actual location in blue. Notice that the stem of the cards  before 4214/5 aca   is 4214/5 ac   and 4214/5 a .  In brief, the structure looks like this:
328      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  –   4214/5 a  *   4214/5 ac  *   4214/5 aca  *   4214/5 aca /1  Note that there’s no 4214/5 ab . I for some reason, just skip right to using  5 ac   because I created   c   before I even knew where I would install the card.  In brief, this isn’t the convention I use these days. In my workflow today,  I would first figure out   where   I wanted to install the card before I wrote the  note. The structure would be something like this instead:  –   4214/5 a  *   4214/5 a /1  *   4214/5 a /2  *   4214/5 a /2/1  In spite of the difference, both conventions are fine. The   imperfections  work just as well. It’s just that my new conventional way of doing things  has changed over time. I find my current convention makes more sense  (to me), and it appears cleaner and more logical (again, to me). For instance,  today I wouldn’t go from 4214/5 a   to 4214/5 ac   (thus skipping 4214/5 ab ).  In addition, I also like a more nested structure, which uses slashes (/). For  instance, I prefer ‘branching down’ and creating 4214/5 a /1 (opposed to  appending letters onto letters, like 4214/5 ab ).  What counts, though, is the actual thought being developed. I never have  the temptation to refactor the addresses of my notes. There’s no temptation  to make my new notes perfectly backward compatible with my old schemes  for numbering. Why? I don’t need to. The system just works.  In brief, don’t delete your mistakes or imperfections. The reason for this is  that there is value in re-reviewing your thoughts or re-reviewing your previous  mistakes to see how much you’ve grown. Or even to see how your previous  corrections   of initially perceived mistakes turned out to also be incorrect! All  of these occurrences are valuable.
329 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     Here’s a secret: even Luhmann didn’t get it right the first time. First, Luh -  mann’s thoughts themselves contained mistakes. Yet he never removed them  from his Antinet. For instance, Johannes Schmidt writes:  It [Luhmann’s Antinet] contains not only validated knowl -  edge but also reflects the thought process,   including poten -  tial mistakes   and blind alleys   that were later revised but not  removed from the file as the original cards always remained in  Luhmann’s file   and perhaps a new card with revisions was  added if needed. 41  Second, Luhmann’s conventions, and the components of his Antinet, were  never deleted. He never deleted his old indexes, for instance, but continually  created more organized versions. After a certain point, his index became  messy. 42   Instead of replacing the index with his new one, he simply placed  the new index   after   the old one. In total, his second Antinet contains four  versions of the index. 43  Not only did Luhmann modify the index component of his Antinet, he also  experimented in other ways. He created an index that was not organized by  concepts’ keyterms, but by people’s names. Luhmann thought that this was  a helpful practice because our minds sometimes retrieve ideas by thinking  of the name of the author from which they derived. 44  41   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution  in Early Modern Europe 53 (2016), 310. Emphasis added.  42   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution  in Early Modern Europe 53 (2016), 306.  43   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution  in Early Modern Europe 53 (2016), 306.  44   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans. Manfred  Kuehn, https://daily.scottscheper.com/zettelkasten/. “This proves to be helpful because  our own memory—others will have similar experiences to mine—works in part with key  words and in part with author’s names.”
330      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Yet when Luhmann created a name-based index, he did not attempt to ret -  roactively make it backward compatible. He did not attempt to go through  all of his previous notecards and make sure the name-based index compre -  hensively referenced each of the notes. He did not   systematically pursue   the  strategy of adding items to the name index in every case. 45  What we learn from these examples is to extinguish any sense of perfection -  ism. That’s right. I’m asking you to extinguish the idea that your Antinet  is to be a perfectly organized system. There’s far more power in creating  paths documenting your various mistakes. The stems of thoughts and ideas  documenting your mind changing stands as an invaluable property of the  Antinet. In addition, you’re encouraged to launch experiments (like Luh -  mann’s people-focused index). But at the same time, don’t feel like you’re  bound to systematically pursuing such an experiment forever. Old exper -  iments are valuable in and of themselves, and who knows—maybe you’ll  pick up where you left off one day and continue developing an experiment  you began ages ago.  DOUBTING THE POWER OF ANALOG  When first starting out, you may not realize the sheer power of analog sys -  tems. In fact, you may still hold a systemic negative regard for analog systems.  Today, society blindly accepts that technology and digital tools are better  for everything. However, digital tools are not better for everything. They’re  certainly not better for thinking and evolving thought.  When you’re just starting out, you may find yourself doubting this. You may  experience false beliefs and doubts about what you’re investing your time  and energy into. Please take my word for it until then. In brief, analog is  worth it. Developing your mind using analog tools pays off in the long-run;  heck, it even pays off in the short-run.  45   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution  in Early Modern Europe 53 (2016), 306. “However, Luhmann did not systematically pursue  this strategy.”
331 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     DON’T BECOME DISTRACTED BY THE  ZETTELKASTEN MYTHS OUT THERE  Perhaps the biggest distraction you’ll face in building an Antinet is the mis -  information and complete inventions you’ll find online about   Zettelkasten .  If you search   Zettelkasten   online, there’s a 96% chance you’ll come across a  myth that misrepresents the system. 46  The myths you come across about Zettelkasten seem innocuous and quite  rational at first. Yet the smallest thing could prevent your notetaking sys -  tem from becoming an actual   second mind —a communication partner. For  instance, if you buy into the whole idea of creating atomic notes (perfectly  organized sets of one idea per card), then you’re setting yourself up for  failure. The many myths of Zettelkasten will be exposed throughout this  book. Until then, just trust me here. Don’t get distracted by the stuff about  Zettelkasten you find online.  YOU’RE LIKE AN AIRPLANE TAKING OFF  Building an Antinet isn’t easy. Especially in the beginning. I’d like to re-em -  phasize a major point: with the Antinet, you’re doing things the old way,  the hard way, the true way. Yet, you’ll be doing so bit-by-bit, card-by-card.  Paradoxically, this turns out to be the easy way in the long-run.  Yet, the major premise in Sönke Ahrens’s presentation of Zettelkasten is the  notion that it will make writing an easy, “seamless” activity. 47   Ahrens makes  it seem like it’s a simple system. He misappropriates Luhmann’s phrase:  “I must tell you that I never force anything. I only do what comes easy to  me.” 48   Ahrens leaves out the fact that Luhmann said this immediately after  46   I pulled the 96% out of my ass; yet, when I surveyed the search results, I found that rough -  ly 9/10 results regurgitate Sönke Ahrens’s interpretation of Zettelkasten, which is   not   how  Luhmann’s Zettelkasten worked.  47   Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing,  Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers (North  Charleston, SC: CreateSpace, 2017), 5.  48   Niklas Luhmann, Short Cuts, Orig.-Ausg., 4.

332      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  outlining his work routine in detail. In brief, Luhmann worked every day  from 8:30am until roughly midnight.  Building out an Antinet requires work and a deliberate investment of energy.  However, you don’t need to work from 8:30am until midnight (for reasons  I’ll outline shortly).  When starting out, it’s best to think of yourself as an airplane taking off. In  the beginning it will require more energy. You’re about to be introduced  to an entirely new way of organizing and evolving your mind, and I’m also  introducing you to a new way of reading and developing your thoughts.  Combined with the overhead expenditure of energy required in learning a  new system, you’re also starting from scratch. You’ll face what I call   index  fatigue . In the beginning, you have a completely barren structure. You’ll  therefore need to spend a considerable amount of time creating new keyterm  entries in your index. This is something that decreases and becomes less  time-consuming after several months.  Don’t get me wrong: you’ll always be creating new keyterm entries in your  index. But, in the beginning you’ll be creating keyterms much more fre -  quently. The important thing is that you manage index fatigue well. Don’t  get burnt out. Don’t land the plane before giving yourself a chance to hit  cruise control.  You Only Need Two Hours a Day  for Great Intellectual Work  While I do hold it to be true that the Antinet is for those who accept the  time investment required, it’s important to provide a caveat. The caveat is  that   consistency is the goal . Keep in mind that Luhmann used his Antinet for  forty-six years (1951–1997). You should strive for the same.  When I preach hard work, don’t interpret my advice as requiring you to  work twelve hours a day on your Antinet. Rather two hours of work per day  consistently   over the long term is a good goal. That means reading or writing  notes for two hours per day (on average).
333 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     The Catholic intellectual Antonin Sertillanges confirms this notion. To do  great intellectual work, a person needs only two hours per day of focused  study. 49   If you work full-time, you must carve out two hours a day—either  before work or after work (or, even split them up). In my early twenties, when  I worked a day job full-time, I carved out two hours of work every morning  before I left for the office. Luhmann carved out his deliberate focus time  with his Antinet in the evenings. 50  As far as intellectual work goes, the   two-hour a day rule   seems to be a theme.  For instance, the scholar Umberto Eco recommends a similar time com -  mitment in his book,   How to Write a Thesis . One can write a quality thesis,  according to Eco, even if “they can only dedicate a few hours each day.” Yet  Eco hints at an even more important variable: one’s   attitude . Those who gain  the most in writing a thesis, it seems, are those who pursue it as a means to  attain a “certain intellectual satisfaction.” 51   That is, those who approach the  process of intellectual work with an attitude that centers   not   on fulfilling an  external requirement, but their own internal requirement. I agree.  ON HAVING A GOAL  Richard W. Hamming, an American mathematician who worked at Bell Lab -  oratories and who greatly influenced how computer and telecommunication  technology works today once observed how shockingly common it was that  his fellow employees were content to work on unimportant problems. They  lacked a clear goal or purpose. He noted how it even seemed like they made  a   deliberate choice   to work on unimportant problems.  Hamming was a scientist obsessed with truth. He had the tendency of  delivering his truth in an unfiltered fashion (often at the expense of other  people’s feelings). One day Hamming approached a fellow employee and  said abruptly,   Why are you even bothering to live if you’re not working on an  49   OP A. G.

334      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  important problem or goal?   The employee, understandably, was quite upset.  He scoffed at Hamming’s offensive words and stormed out of the room.  Later the employee wrote a letter to Hamming thanking him. The letter read:  Thank you. Your words ended up changing my life . 52  This brings us to the crux of the matter: goals. Specifically,   your   goals in  building an Antinet. This matter is so important that you must explore it in  detail before setting out to build your Antinet.  It can be argued that people are too fascinated with Luhmann’s Antinet, to  the extent that many people overlook the famous declaration Luhmann  made. At the beginning of his intellectual career, Luhmann was one of  the first professors hired by Bielefeld University. The new administration  asked Luhmann what research project he would work on. His response was  legendary amongst sociologists: “My project was, and ever since has been,  the theory of society; term: thirty years; costs: none.” 53  The Antinet served as the perfect tool for Luhmann because it helped him  with his ambitious goal. His goal was a massive undertaking. It was a thirty  year project that required a system that would enable him to develop and  evolve his thinking over the course of it.  This brings up the question:   what is the goal of an Antinet in the first place?  In a sense, the ultimate goal of an Antinet centers on “maximizing the number  of copies of the genes that created it.” 54   Consider this: the goal of Luhmann’s  Antinet was to maximize the proliferation of his ideas. He intended to do  this by packing in evidence from all of his readings. He began by extracting  knowledge from books onto their bibcards. From there he would develop  52   Richard W. Hamming and Bret Victor, The Art of Doing Science and Engineering:  Learning to Learn (Stripe Press, 2020), 386.  53   Niklas Luhmann, Theory of Society, Volume 1, trans.

335 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     that knowledge by elaborating on it (primarily by way of reflection notes).  These notes would then chain together and create deeply rich knowledge  that supported his theory of society.  In other words, Luhmann was reproducing and creating a legacy from his  thoughts as they developed in his Antinet.  The goal of the Antinet, then, is to replicate the thoughts of its creator in the  real world. Think of the thoughts as intellectual genetic material encompassed  in notecards. Therefore, the goal centers on reproduction—not biologi -  cal reproduction, but metaphysical reproduction of your thoughts—and  metaphysical reproduction of your thinking throughout the world. This  is achieved through your thoughts being so well-developed that they end  up producing work that reproduces those thoughts and allows them to be  spread throughout the world.  Luhmann’s Antinet seems to have achieved this. His books are studied  by scholars today—or at least studied by the ones with the diligence and  motivation to parse his deeply intertwined texts! Yet, ironically, Luhmann’s  Antinet seems to have the potential to proliferate and live on longer than  even Luhmann’s actual theoretical work will. Or perhaps it’s not so ironic.  People are fascinated with how Luhmann became a book-writing academic  research machine. The answer? The Antinet.  In essence, the goal of the Antinet is to reproduce the thoughts of its creator  by making it easier to create written products with the thoughts it stores.  Let’s now turn to the dichotomy of   growth   vs.   contribution .  GROWTH VS. CONTRIBUTION  There are two   states   one operates in when using the Antinet. One is not  necessarily better than the other. In fact, you’ll likely move back and forth  between each state regularly.  The first state is the   growth   state. This occurs when using an Antinet to   grow  your own knowledge and understanding. Whenever you’re venturing into a
336      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  new disciplinary field, you’ll spend the beginning phases learning by reading  books in brand new fields and noting down brand new ideas. You’ll mostly  be writing   reformulation notes   in this phase. You’ll be encountering new ideas  and reformulating them in your own words.  The second state is the   contribution   state. This occurs when using the Anti -  net to publish work and the focus is on contributing to others through  teaching them material. In this stage your focus will be books that  you’re creating.  You will often oscillate between the two states. However, I find that it’s best  to strive and live in the   contribution   state. In other words, you want to write  your notes as if they are part of a project or book that you’ll be publishing  so that you can   teach   others. It’s a paradox because the best way to   grow   and  learn something is by teaching the material, and the best way to   do that   is  through having the mindset of   contribution .  In the beginning of working on your Antinet, you may not be ready to  actually commit to a certain project. I certainly wasn’t when I began my  journey. However, I would like to nudge you in the direction of moving  toward   contribution .  If Luhmann had not set out with the ambitious goal of creating a the -  ory of society in thirty years, there’s a good chance we never would have  even heard about the Zettelkasten in the first place. In essence, Luhmann’s  Antinet wasn’t the only thing that helped him create genius-level work.  The other thing that helped him was his massive ambitious goal for his  Antinet.  The most important step to creating an Antinet that is too easily overlooked  is determining what your goal is before writing your first note. It is the  overall objective— the why —behind what attracted you to the Antinet that  is critically important.  You ought to have at least a vague or general direction for what you intend  to build with it.
337 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     As Steven Pinker points out in his book,   How the Mind Works , without  specifying a goal “the very idea of intelligence is meaningless.” 55  And what is intelligence? It is the phenomenon the Antinet is engineered  to create. Intelligence comes from information. Information is a correlation  between two things. Before you install anything in your Antinet, you will  compare   and   correlate . You must decide if a concept is “this or something  else,” as Luhmann says. 56  In brief, it helps to specify a goal. To be fair, however, the system works  perfectly even when you’re in a state in which your goal is to learn and grow.  Luhmann’s second Zettelkasten was started when he had a clear goal in mind.  His first Zettelkasten, however, was started when he didn’t have a clear idea  of what his intellectual work would entail in the years he was working for the  Higher Administrative Court of Lüneburg. During this time, he spent his  nights reading and building his Antinet. He said, “I started my Zettelkasten,  because I realized that I had to plan for a life and not for a book.” 57  This statement seems to contradict his reason for starting his second Antinet  (the Antinet he created in order to work on his thirty-year book project  culminating in his   Theory of Society ).  You might notice, though, that Luhmann did have a goal for his first Zettelkas -  ten: it was to plan for life by learning from many fields of knowledge.  In brief, the Antinet can serve both states. It can assist someone who’s in the  growth state (without a clear end goal), and it can also assist someone who’s  in the contribution state (with a clearly defined book or project).  55   Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works, Norton pbk (New York: Norton, 2009), 61.  56   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

338      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  From my experience, I have found the Antinet to   really   shine when one is in  the contribution state. When you have a specific project and goal in mind,  the Antinet really begins to flex its strength.  In essence, what we’re talking about here is the   explore vs. exploit   dilemma.  That is, do you approach work as an explorer with an open-mind? Or do you  approach your work with a deliberate goal, and exploit an opportunity you  see? The explore-exploit tradeoff occurs every single day. It can be as simple  as going to your favorite restaurant, or trying out a new one. 58  In approaching this dilemma, I like a concept introduced by clinical psy -  chologist and bestselling author Jordan Peterson. One ought to define a  deliberate goal to limit the chaos of life. Yet one also ought to adopt a   meta  goal . The term   meta , in Greek, means   above   or   beyond . Therefore, one ought  to have a goal which resides above a concrete project in the physical world.  An example of a meta goal is to “live in truth.” That is, a meta goal allows one  to act diligently toward a defined end in an authentic way that remains in  alignment with your soul. 59   Have a defined goal, yes; however, if your soul  authentically shifts, shift with it.  BEFORE WRITING YOUR FIRST NOTE  One critical point that rarely gets mentioned may seem rather obvious: it’s  helpful to have a project in mind for your Antinet. An Antinet is not neces -  sarily something you ought to do with the idea of completely open-ended  reading. As Luhmann states, “I first make a plan of what I am going to write,  and then take from the note cabinet what I can use.” 60   When Luhmann drew  from the Antinet the material would use for a new project, that material did  not come about through aimless reading. At some point, he made a decision  on what project to work on.  58   “Explore-Exploit Tradeoff—Definition and Examples,” Conceptually, accessed April 12,  2022, https://conceptually.org/concepts/explore-or-exploit.  59   Jordan B.

339 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     The key point is that when you decide to work on a project, it doesn’t nec -  essarily confine you to that project forever. The material you create in one  project will unearth material you can use in your next project.  For instance, when I first started building out my Antinet, I didn’t yet realize  I was going to write a book on it. I was planning on writing a book that sat at  the intersection of copywriting, psychology, and philosophy. My readings  included books like   The Hero with a Thousand Faces , which is about the hero’s  journey and storytelling. It didn’t seem like any of the material would have  been relevant to this book; yet, as it turns out, it was relevant! In my section  on the tree structure of the Antinet, I used some of the material in discussing  the metaphysical power pertaining to the concept of trees. Moreover, reading  about the power of trees may have helped spark the light bulb that helped  me realize that the Antinet is built on a tree structure.  What I’m trying to say is this: take a goal-oriented approach when building out  your Antinet. Do not worry if, later on, you decide to progress to a completely  different project. Why? Because it’s likely the material you develop will still  contribute to the new project. All domains of knowledge are interdisciplinary.  Concepts in mathematics can serve one’s understanding of philosophical  concepts. The great mathematician Bertrand Russell also penned one of  the best books ever written on philosophy ( A History of Western Philosophy ,  which won him a Nobel Prize in 1950). This is but one of countless examples.  I’ll keep hammering this idea into you: having a goal or project in mind is  critical when developing notes using an Antinet. Even when reading a book,  the goal-oriented nature and intention of reading is paramount. 61   I’ll illustrate  this principle more in the chapter on reading workflows.  The reason I keep emphasizing this is because the magic of the Antinet  really started taking off for me once I shifted to   contribution . In mid-  June 2021, I made a decision to focus on teaching the true Zettelkasten—  the Luhmannian version—the Antinet Zettelkasten. Up until that point I was  61   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev. and updat -  ed ed (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 45.
340      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  resisting the idea of writing a book about the Antinet. I feared it would just  be a distraction or procrastination-fueled detour. It also appeared seemingly  absurd at the time. My profession and craft was in marketing, copywriting,  and cryptocurrency (which are much more lucrative markets). The PKM  and productivity market is as niche as it gets. And within that niche almost  everyone focuses on teaching the powerful “method” of whatever the latest  and greatest digital app is.  Yet, I knew in my heart and soul the truth: analog tools serve as a much more  effective system for developing thought. I knew in my heart that people were  left with watered down digital Zettelkasten tools. There were no instruc -  tions or guides for how to build an analog version—the original version.  I couldn’t let it go. So, even with doubts in my mind, I made a commitment.  To hell with the copywriting, psychology and philosophy project for now , I said  to myself.   I’m going all in on the Antinet .  This is when things really started to take off. At this point I began to expe -  rience the magic of the Antinet. Yet even before this commitment to the  Antinet, I made a   soft   commitment to working on a copywriting, psychology  and philosophy project.  Again, commit to an idea or project and don’t fret if you decide to shift  into a different project altogether. You can shift back to the original project  whenever you’re done with the new project. You can also shift back to dif -  ferent projects if you hit a wall (figuratively speaking). As Luhmann says  (after outlining his twelve-plus-hour work days): “I only write when I know  immediately how to do it. If it stops for a moment, I put the thing aside and  do something else.” 62   However, don’t let Luhmann’s turn you into someone  who switches tasks every other day. Try to start things you’ll finish. Commit  to them, but also know they can be revisited if you ever decide to switch to  something else after a few months.  Johannes Schmidt writes, “at least in the more mature stage of Luhmann’s  theory-building since the 1970s, [Luhmann’s Antinet]   did not serve as a  pure archive that he would develop independent of specific publication projects .”  62   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 19.
341 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     Luhmann only installed cards in his Antinet that were related to publication  requests he took on. 63  Yet, as Schmidt points out, the material Luhmann developed during the course  of fulfilling publication requests—by writing research papers—ended up  serving as the basis for his books. By taking on one project, the new material  created unforeseeable developments in his other long-term projects. As Luh -  mann worked on new publications, “in the process, he would also document  the evolution of his thought process,” writes Schmidt. “Over the course of  producing these publications,” his theory developments were   compounded . 64  HOW TO BUILD AN ANTINET  OK, now that you know the obstacles to avoid, we can now get into building  your Antinet.

342      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  THE SUPPLIES YOU NEED  To help perfect the way I teach the Antinet, I conducted a series of 1-on-1  Antinet coaching sessions (the recordings of which you can find on my  YouTube channel).  With each of my Antinet coaching clients, I recommend the following  materials for getting started:  1.   Three noteboxes that can store 4 x 6 inch notecards (or one box, if you wish  to save space for now).  2.   A set of blank double-sided 4 x 6 inch notecards.  3.   A set of ruled colored 4 x 6 inch indexcards.  4.   A set of alphabetical card dividers, wherein each divider label contains a  dedicated alphabetical letter (i.e.,   A ,   B ,   C , etc.).  You will also need a badass pen. Use a pen you love to write with. Think of  it as an   instrument . People apply a ton of creativity to what colors they use.  You’re welcome to use whichever set of colors work best for you. I’ve exper -  imented with different colored inks over time. My current ink repertoire  is black ink for main notes, green ink for cardlinks, and red ink for ExRefs  (i.e., citing books and external sources).  BUILDING OUT YOUR MAIN BOX AND INDEX BOX  In my experience coaching people through this process, I find that most  people don’t have a problem taking notes from the books they read. Taking  reading notes is straightforward. Heck, it’s even addicting and fun! Those  types of notes are filed in the bib box. I’ll cover that in the next section which  involves reading strategies.  We’re going to skip the bib box part for now. Instead we’re going to dive  right into the heart of the Antinet, the so-called “hard part” of this whole  thing. We’re going to build out the   main box   and   index box   of your Antinet.  Realize that you’re not going to really understand why I’m telling you to

From these  five branches, many other branches will “branch off.” Stems will form, and  leaves of notecards will fill up the tree. Right now, your tree of knowledge  is barren. We’ll fix that soon.  The second box containing 26 cards is your index. Your index is the map you  create as you build your tree of knowledge.  Now, pull out another blank notecard.  On this notecard, write out the following quote. However, before you  write it out, make sure you leave about a centimeter of space at the top  of the quote.
347 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     “One of the most basic presuppositions of communication  is that the partners can mutually surprise each other. Only  in this way can information be produced in the respective  other. Information is an intra-systematic event. It results  when one compares one message or entry with regard to  other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only  in systems which possess a comparative schema—even if this  only amounts to ‘this or something else.’”  It should look like this:  At this point, you’re probably wondering why the heck I made you write  down this excerpt. After all, your reason for using an Antinet probably won’t  focus on writing about   communication theory   or   information theory .  The reason why I chose to start with this is to show the flexibility of the  system we’re about to create.  You see, in Luhmann’s first Antinet, he created 108 top-level categories. They  were rough starting points. They included many topics he was interested
348      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  in. Yet when he created his second Antinet, it was focused primarily on his  theoretical sociological work.  If Luhmann had started out with a broader classification system (instead  of his arbitrarily chosen 108 categories), I hold that he would never have  needed to create a second Antinet. If he had structured his first Antinet to  be all-encompassing, he could have created a branch (or set of branches),  which nicely encompassed his theoretical sociological work.  The goal with your Antinet is to avoid having to make a second, separate  Antinet; to reach that goal, you’ll use an all-encompassing structure to  house all your knowledge so that you can use the same Antinet for the rest  of your life.  This will be made possible by using a well-developed and robust classifica -  tion system. For this reason, I choose to use the academic disciplinary fields  provided by Wikipedia.  Here is a link to Wikipedia’s   Outline of academic disciplines :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_academic_disciplines  This classification system will serve as a   rough   guide for how to structure  your Antinet.  You will notice that the contents of the academic disciplines have five top-  level branches. These five top-level branches map directly to the five branches  you already created. The sub-branches of each of these categories can be  created and numbered arbitrarily. The choice of the numbers and whether  or not to even create the sub-branch is entirely up to you.

OK, so where should we place the notecard we’ve just created?  The quote I had you write on the notecard is from Niklas Luhmann. He’s  writing of the Antinet as his communication partner. He’s observing that  information   comes about by comparing something to something else. I guess  it could be filed in either an   information   branch, or a   communication   branch.  But which one? In my opinion, the primary idea in this quote revolves around  information , so let’s go with that.  Now, let’s open up the Wikipedia’s academic disciplines page, and search the  page for the term   information . What we find are twenty-one search results for the  term   information   on the page. We also find that the first three seem irrelevant…
350      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  But, aha! The fourth result seems intriguing…it’s something called   Informa -  tion Theory . What the heck is   Information Theory ? Let’s find out.     Pull out another blank notecard. In the middle write:  Information Theor y  Information Theory studies the transmission, processing,  extraction, and utilization of information.  It should look like this:  Still with me?  Good.  You now have two cards in front of you. One with the quote written on it,  and the other for Information Theory. If you don’t, retrace your steps (and  get your shit together). Kidding, but seriously.
351 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     Let’s keep going.  So now we have two cards with handwritten stuff on them.  Where should we file these cards?  Let’s start with the second card we wrote. The one that outlines   Infor -  mation Theory .  By consulting Wikipedia’s academic disciplines, we can see that   Information  Theory   falls under the field of   Formal Sciences . It falls specifically within the  subfield of   Computer Science .     Still with me? Cool. Now pull out another blank card.     In the top-corner write, 4200 and in the middle write:  Computer Science  Computer Science is the study of computation, automation,  and information.  It should look like this:
352      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN     Now it’s time to consult the index. In your index box find the   list indexcard  C and pull it out.     With the card C, write an entry that reads Computer Science: ‘4200’.  It should look something like this:  I like to put little quotes around cardlinks so they feel more contained.  It’s just a personal preference.     Now place the C list indexcard back inside the index box. File the card  4200 behind the card 4000 in the main box.  OK, now back to the   Information Theory   card.  Where should we file the   Information Theory   card?     Let’s place it within the   Computer Science   branch. Why? Because according  to Wikipedia’s   Outline of Academic Disciplines ,   Information Theory   falls under  Computer Science . So, let’s arbitrarily choose 4212 for   Information Theory .
353 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET        In the top-corner of the   Information Theory   card write 4212.  It should look like this:     Now file this card in your main box behind card 4200.  Good job so far!  Now, there should be one remaining card in front of you—the card with  the long-quote on it. Let’s figure out where to file this card.  In the Antinet, the name of the game is   similarity . When figuring out where  to install a card, you must ask:   What is this card most similar to?  OK, so what is this card in front of us most similar to? That’s easy. It’s most  similar to the   Information Theory   card. Indeed, it even falls within the   Infor -  mation Theory   branch.     In the top-right corner of the card write 4212/1.
354      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  It should look like this:  Heck yes! We’re all done, right? Almost, but not quite.  There are a few more things we ought to do.     First, pull out the list indexcard I from your index box.     Create an entry: Information Theory, and next to that write, 4212  It should look like this:
355 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     There’s another thing we ought to do (since we’re pros).     Let’s add an entry under list indexcard C for   Communication   within the  context of   Information Theory . Pull out the list indexcard C and write  Communication (within Information Theory): ‘4212/1’.  It should look like this:     OK, now file away C by putting it back in your index box.  In front of you, there should be one notecard: 4212/1. Before you install  4212/1 into your main box, we have one more thing we need to do.  On 4212/1, what you did was write down a quote. The notion that Luhmann  never wrote down excerpts or quotes is a myth. Luhmann did, indeed, write  down quotes from the books he read. That said, you want to err on the side  of creating more   reformulation notes   and   reflection notes   (instead of   excerpt  notes ). I’ll detail those types of notes in a later chapter. For now, it’s helpful  to start you off with an excerpt note (which is why I had you write down  that quote)!
356      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  When you create an excerpt note, it requires one thing. It must also provide  the source   from where the quote came from. To answer this, we shall now  dive into External Reference Links (“ExRefs”).  Stay with me; we’re almost done.     On a computer, download the reference manager called   Zotero   by visit -  ing   www.zotero.org .     After you download and install Zotero on your computer, there is one  more step. You must download the Zotero connector for your web browser.  Visit the following link and download the connector for the browser that  you use: https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors     Next, open up Zotero.     Now, using the browser in which you have the Zotero Connector installed,  visit the following URL: https://daily.scottscheper.com/zettelkasten/  This URL is where the quote originated from. It is an English translation  of a paper titled   Communication with Noteboxes   by Niklas Luhmann. 67     While viewing this web page, click the Zotero icon which should now be  installed in the panel of your browser. It should capture the page and add  it as an entry to your Zotero Desktop application.  67   I host this paper on a website I created while I was releasing daily writing pieces (part of  a daily publishing challenge).
357 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET        Now, switch over to the Zotero Desktop application. Click on the new  entry. It should look something like this:  After clicking on the entry, you should see four buttons in the right-hand  area: Info, Notes, Tags, and Related.     Click   Tags .     Add a new tag and name it r.TDSSZ. 68  The “r.” prepended to the reference identifier indicates that we’re referencing  an ExRef stored in Zotero.  Ok, now let’s jump back to the card 4212/1.     Take out a pen. One with red ink.     Immediately after the quote ends, add a little footnote in red ink by writ -  ing [1] after it. In the bottom-left corner, with red ink as well, write the  following: 1. r.TDSSZ. This signals to us where this quote originated from.  68   Since the website was created by yours truly, and since it is called The Daily Scott Scheper,  and, since it is a page about Zettelkasten, that’s where the abbreviation comes from:  “TDSSZ.”
358      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The card 4212/1 should now look like this:  Now take a look at that beautiful card in front of you. Bask in its glory.     Now file it away behind notecard 4212.  That’s it for now.  This should give you a taste for what it’s like working with an Antinet.  You now have your main box and index box built out.  Eventually, as you build out your Antinet, it will grow significantly. Instead  of one main box, you’ll have many main boxes. In fact, you’ll probably end  up with a box for each of the five branches you’ve created. A box each for  1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000. At that point, your Antinet will have grown  to look like this:
359 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     One of the things I recommend picking up is a set of alphabetical card dividers.  The card dividers are useful for when your index box expands. They’re also  useful for storing bibcards in your bib box (which I’ll outline in the chapter  on   Extraction ).  Here’s a picture of my index box:
360      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The alphabetical dividers are helpful for sorting through the indexcards quickly.  These are mere conveniences. You don’t need them to thrive in the beginning,  but they’re things you’ll want to add to your Antinet as it grows.  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  There’s a chance you’ll have questions come up that I haven’t addressed fully.  In such a case, a good resource is the Antinet Reddit Community ( www.  reddit.com/r / Antinet ). There’s also a good chance the question you may  have has been answered there, not just by myself, but by other Antinetters,  as well. In addition, I recommend you visit my website as another resource  ( www.scottscheper.com ). On my website, and through my email list, I share  a wealth of Antinet resources.  With that said, I’d like to address a few questions I get asked frequently.  WHERE SHOULD I PLACE THIS CARD?  It seems like the most common area where people get hung up is the numer -  ic-alpha addresses. We imagine that there’s some   correct   place or area for a  card to be filed. That’s one of the downsides of using academic disciplines  as a classification system. It implies that there’s some perfect and correct  place for a certain card to be placed.  Let me make it perfectly clear: the correct place for any card is to install it  near its most similar neighbor .  If you want to install a card in a more remote location, under a branch you  feel fits better, simply create a cardlink for it. For instance, my main section  where I write about the Antinet resides at 4214. However, there are certain  sections related to that topic, which live in other locations.  For example, I have a section about   writing by hand , which is discussed in  4214/3 d /3 b . However, I also have a section on the power of writing by hand  in section 1323. Why? Because the section 1323 resides closer to my section  on   writing . This isn’t a problem. I just have a card within 4214/3 d /3 b   that  says, For more on writing by hand, see also: ‘1323’.
361 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     If you’re struggling to figure out how to make branches for your cards,  remember that there’s no correct solution. It’s arbitrary. Each scenario will  work. If you’re trying to figure out whether to create a branch at 4212 vs. 4300,  let me offer some guidance: if the area will comprise a significant portion of  your work with many sub-branches, then I’d opt for 4300. This grants you  the ability to organize a structure like this:  –   4300  *   4310  *   4311  *   4312  *   4320  However, even if you elected to go with 4212, you’ll be fine. You can organize  such a branch like this:  –   4212  *   4212/10  *   4212/10/1  *   4212/10/2  *   4212/20  These are very clean examples. However, in reality, when you use an Antinet,  it’s never perfectly clean. It’s a system of ordered chaos. Embrace it. Stop  trying to confine the infinite depths of knowledge to some preconceived  set of categories.  Your Antinet, over time, will evolve into a unique structure. This gives it  a personality. This is what transforms it into an   alter-ego , a   second mind ,  a   communication partner .  WHAT IF I ALREADY HAVE A CARD THERE?  Another question I get asked pertains to what you should do if you already  have a card installed in the desired location.  For instance, take the following sequence:
362      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  –   4214  *   4214/1  *   4214/1/1  *   4214/1 a  *   4214/2  Now, say you want to install a card immediately after 4214/1. The only prob -  lem is that 4214/1/1 is already there. What are you to do?  The solution is quite simple. Simply create a card 4214/1/0.  This then naturally brings up a follow-up question. What do you do when  you want to install a card before 4214/1/0?  Again, it’s simple, move into the negatives. What comes before zero? Why,  negative-one comes before zero! Simply create 4214/1/-1  Now, using negative numbers is something Luhmann did not do; however,  I’ve found it to work quite well for me.  As a result you’ll have:  –   4214  *   4214/1  *   4214/1/-1  *   4214/1/0  *   4214/1/1  *   4214/1 a  *   4214/2  WHAT IF A CARD FITS INTO  MULTIPLE CATEGORIES?  Let’s go deeper into the question of where to install cards. Again, the game  you’re playing with the Antinet is   associating   the card next to, or under, its  most similar neighbor .
363 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     This exercises the   comparison faculty   of your brain. Comparison, again, is a  critical process for creating   information , a precursor for knowledge.  If a card fits into multiple categories, first off, do not get anxiety about it.  “Every place is adequate,” as Johannes Schmidt says. “The card only has to  connect with the card before it.” 69  But what happens if you have a card that fits into two different places in  your Antinet?  There are three primary ways to handle this: (1) Index Cardlinks, (2) Hoplink  Cards, and (3) “See Also” Cardlinks.  Index Cardlinks  In the walkthrough we just went through in building your own Antinet, we  encountered a scenario where a card fits into the   information   branch, as well  the   communication   branch. What we did was simply choose to install it in  the   information   branch. We then created an entry in the list indexcard for C,  writing Communication (within Info. Theory): ‘4212/1’.  This is an index cardlink. Whenever you’re ready to create a branch in the  main box of the Antinet for   Communication , you’ll also see that you have  a card pertaining to   Communication   within the   Information Theory   branch.  Hoplink Cards  Another way of handling this would be to create a new card and place it in  the   Communication   branch (whenever it’s created). On the card, it would  simply say, For Communication in the context of Information Theory, visit  ‘4212/1’. This is what I call a   hoplink card . Luhmann created these types of  cards, as well.  Here’s an example hoplink card:  69 Undisciplined, Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt, 2021, https://www.youtube.  com/watch?v=kz2K3auPLWU, 36:50.
364      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  More on hoplink cards are explored in the chapter,   Creation .  “See Also” Cardlinks  In most cases, you don’t need to create a dedicated hoplink card. At the  bottom of a card already written about   communication , you can simply add  a bit of text at the bottom that says: See also: ‘4214/5AE/2’. Here’s an example  from my own Antinet:
365 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     This is a “see also” cardlink.  As you can see (pun intended), numeric-alpha addresses are powerful. They  enable a whole wealth of possibilities and ways to link bits of your knowl -  edge together to generate new connections. This is where a system like the  Antinet really begins to outshine other systems.  “SEE ALSO” EXREFS  “See also” cardlinks not only pertain to internal cardlinks (which link to cards  within your Antinet). They can also be used for ExRefs (external references).  For instance, say you read a book that contains a good passage relating to  Love . Yet you’re not working actively on a project related to   Love . Instead  of developing an elaborate main note on love, for sake of time, you can  simply create an entry, which reads See also: r.Moeller, 36. Luhmann did  this frequently.  HOW DO I CREATE NOTES FOR  COLD HARD FACTS?  While writing the section at the beginning of this book, I received the fol -  lowing question:   How do I install cold hard facts in my Antinet?  The individual who asked me this question works in the field of French  real estate law. He was wondering where to file the following note: “French  real estate law requires each condominium to be divided by unit, and each  apartment is a unit.”  On this matter, I’ll say a few things.  I have indeed installed cold hard facts in my own Antinet. They are cards  like population size by country, revenue figures of businesses, etc.  However, I created these cold hard fact cards in the pre-Antinet days. 70  So that’s one reason they even exist. I have since retroactively gone back and  70   For over a decade, and before discovering the Antinet, I used a notebox system organized
366      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  installed many of these cold hard fact cards into my Antinet. In every case,  I’ve found the academic disciplinary fields to accommodate them. There’s  always a branch for where they can go. And even if there isn’t a clear branch  within the academic disciplinary fields, you can just create one (and likely  place it in branch 5000).  I like to place my cold hard fact cards on 3 x 5 inch cards. I like to consult  them from time to time in order to unearth accidental insights.  Yet, as I touched upon in the beginning of this book, the Antinet is   primarily  useful for creators. It’s useful for those who wish to elaborate on thoughts  and evolve them by   reflecting   on them. You evolve your thoughts by linking  them to more thoughts filed behind them.  If you wish to just memorize a bunch of cold hard facts, an Antinet may be  overkill. Heck, even digital tools like   Anki   do the trick for this type of thing.  Of course, there is certainly value to be obtained from the act of writing  facts down by hand.  Typically, those who benefit most from an Antinet are writers, researchers,  and creators who wish to   evolve   thought.  After sharing my response with the individual who asked the question about  cold hard facts, he provided more clarity. In actuality, his work in French  real estate law is for his thesis. In this case, the Antinet will have more use,  and provide more value.  To wrap this up, it is possible to use the Antinet to store cold hard facts.  For example, you’d place the previously mentioned card in   Real Estate Law  branch. For instance, 1310. Near that branch, you could create a branch for  French Real Estate Law at 1312. Within that branch, you can begin creating  cards pertaining to specific laws at 1312/1. Again, these numbers are arbitrary  and can be chosen by you based on personal whim.  by book or category (like Ryan Holiday’s notebox system).
367 T HE   H ITCHHIKER ’ S   G UIDE   TO   THE   A NTINET     CONCLUSION  We’ve covered a lot in this chapter. We started with important principles  involved in building an Antinet. We covered the mindset with which you  should approach the beginning phases of building an Antinet. We emphasized  that you must not get lost in the trap of perfectionism. We also capped off  this preamble with the concept of   goals , and   growth vs. contribution .  We then dove headfirst into building out your own Antinet. If you followed  the steps (which I hope you did), you now have a solid base. You have the  start of your own Antinet!  Now that you have a solid foundation, it’s time to embark upon the next  phase of our journey:   Knowledge Development . Get ready. This section of  the book is a lot more fun than it sounds. It also serves as the core process  for building your knowledge. Let’s go.
368  C H A PT E R T W E LV E  �  KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT  T he category Zettelkasten finds itself   lumped into is called   per -  sonal knowledge management   (PKM). PKM is a disciplinary subfield of  knowledge management   concerned with the personal collection, organization,  storing, and sharing of digital information.  As it applies to the Antinet, I dislike the categorical term PKM for several  reasons. First off, notetaking systems do not exclusively contain knowl -  edge; they contain information, which helps one develop knowledge.  In addition, the entire point of Luhmann’s Antinet centered on the   develop -  ment   of knowledge (not   management   of knowledge).  Luhmann’s Antinet is not seen as a memory tool, but a   thinking tool . It’s a  thinking tool that aims to develop one’s thoughts. It’s a very active system, not  something that is properly encompassed by the term   management . Because  it requires action, a better term for it is   development . The goal of the Antinet  is to develop one’s   thoughts   (revealed in the notes you create), as well as your  own   thinking   (revealed in how your brain works to link together ideas). For  this reason, I encompass both   thoughts   and   thinking   under the umbrella term  knowledge . In turn this gives us the label in which I categorize the Antinet:  a   knowledge development system .  TWO PROCESSES OF KNOWLEDGE  DEVELOPMENT  As Johannes Schmidt observes, there are two processes of the Antinet as
369 K NOWLEDGE   D EVELOPMENT     a knowledge development system. The first process involves developing  thought through the practice of writing by hand. The second process involves  interacting with the Antinet as a communication partner. 1  PROCESS I: SHORT-TERM KNOWLEDGE  DEVELOPMENT  In Luhmann’s own Antinet, one finds the following handwritten note:  “Underlying the filing technique is the experience that without writing,  there is no thinking.” 2  1   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication Partner,  Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe 53 (2016), 309.  2   “ZK II: Paper 9/8g—Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed April 18, 2022,   https://niklas-luh -  mann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8g_V .
370      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  In the short term, the Antinet enables users to develop thought through  the practice of writing by hand. As I’ve illustrated throughout this text,  I contend that this practice develops thought better than digital systems  because of the deliberate attention required. As Schmidt observes, “writing  things down enables disciplined thinking in the first place.” 3   I also contend  that the analog nature of the Antinet develops one’s   thinking   better because  it neuroimprints ideas on the mind far more effectively than digital tools.  PROCESS II: LONG-TERM KNOWLEDGE  DEVELOPMENT  As Schmidt highlights, the second process of knowledge development centers  on the Antinet emerging as a   communication partner   during research. This  happens by way of the tree structure of the Antinet   evolving   your thoughts  over the long term.  3   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution  in Early Modern Europe 53 (2016), 309.
371 K NOWLEDGE   D EVELOPMENT     When you begin exploring your notes as you prepare to write a manuscript,  a communication experience emerges. For instance, you first come upon a  note written seven years ago. Following this note is a newer note recently  added which seemingly contradicts the first note. What happens next illus -  trates the internal dialogue that takes place: you question   why   the notes  contradict one another, and then you begin investigating the sources of  the notes. You begin investigating your chain of thoughts that resulted in  coming away with a different understanding from what you now hold as true.  This is an instance that exemplifies the long-term thought development that  takes place while using an Antinet. Thoughts are developed both in the short  term as well as the long term.  Before we get into the four specific phases of knowledge development, let’s  first take a step back into the abstract land of information science.  THE NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE AND  INFORMATION  In order to better understand knowledge, we need to distinguish it from  its close relatives:   data ,   information , and   wisdom . This brings us to the  DIKW pyramid .  THE DIKW PYRAMID  A convenient model that emerged within the information science field is  called the DIKW pyramid.
372      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Like all models of reality, the pyramid is fuzzy and imperfect. Every scholar  in information science seems to have their own interpretation of the four  components of the pyramid. For instance, one paper contains 130 different  definitions of   data ,   information   and   knowledge   from 45 different scholars.  The paper was created because it recognized that an issue with information  science revolves around the lack of clarity on these fundamental concepts. 4  The different components of the DIKW pyramid get so fuzzy that I almost  scratched this entire section when I started to second-guess whether or not  I was getting things right. I would read one scholar’s explanation and come  away with an understanding of   information   only to find another scholar  classifying the same thing as   knowledge !  Regardless, I’ve assembled the following explanations, which are more than  sufficient for our purposes.  Data  Data   is raw, unprocessed stimuli from the universe. The raw material can  be physical in nature or metaphysical in nature. Data is raw material, like  the universe’s energy waves and particles: light, heat, sound, force, and  electromagnetic components. Think of data as sound wave represented in  computer symbols like   010110100011011 . We cannot understand what this  data means at this point.  Information  “ To be informed is to know simply that something is the case .”  –Mortimer Adler 5  Before data can be converted to information, it undergoes a phase transi -  tion. The phase transition is the   interpretation phase . This phase involves our  4   Chaim Zins, “Conceptual Approaches for Defining Data, Information, and Knowledge,”  Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 58, no. 4  (2007): 479–93.  5   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev.  and updated ed (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 11.
373 K NOWLEDGE   D EVELOPMENT     sensory system (sight, smell, sound, taste, touch, balance). For example, our  ears receive data, and then interpret the data. We then transcribe the data  into forms we can comprehend.  In brief, information is data we can comprehend. For instance, the sound  wave data from the previous example ( 010110100011011 ) is interpreted through  one’s ears. It is then transitioned into a comprehensible sound:   the sound of  a train , which is information.  Knowledge  “ To be enlightened is to know, in addition, what it is all about: why  it is the case, what its connections are with other facts, in what  respects it is the same, in what respects it is different, and so forth .”  –Mortimer Adler 6  Knowledge is information multiplied by   meaning . Knowledge is   useful  information. I also like to think of knowledge as   structured information .  Knowledge integrates, correlates, and collects several pieces of information. 7  Say, for instance, we have the information that the sound we just heard is  that of a train. Knowledge assembles and structures other   useful   pieces of  information onto this: the information comprising the   who ,   what ,   where ,  and   when   properties attached to data. 8   For instance, we know what we heard  sounds like a train (what). Yet we piece this information together with other  properties: it involves you and the train (who), its general direction (where),  and how recently we heard it (when).  Knowledge enables us to connect and structure these disparate pieces of  information together to create meaning. It tells us,   holy crap ,   I ’ m on the train  tracks right now and I just heard a train .

374      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Wisdom  “ Intelligent action depends on knowledge .”  –Mortimer Adler 9  Wisdom is knowledge multiplied by   action . When you take action after the  information phase, that’s   intuitive action . However, when you take action  after the knowledge phase, you’re taking   wise action . You’re making a decision  based on multiple pieces of information. This doesn’t mean you’re necessarily  taking the   right   action; however, it does mean you have a higher likelihood  of taking the right action. Knowing things only gets one so far; wise action  stands as a critical phase.  Formulaic Summary  Here’s a formulaic summary of what we just covered:  Data   =   Raw Stimuli  Information   =   Comprehension   x   Data  Knowledge   =   Information   x   Meaning  Wisdom   =   Knowledge   x   Action  KNOWLEDGE CREATION AND SHARING  IS THE GOAL  With the Antinet, the goal is to create   knowledge , not information. Informa -  tion is a means to an end. We don’t just want to collect facts and material  we can comprehend; we want to create   knowledge .  This is why I routinely advise against wasting your time with things like  publishing your notes. When it comes to sharing publicly, err on the side  of publishing knowledge over information.  9   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev.  and updated ed (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 65.
375 K NOWLEDGE   D EVELOPMENT     When you possess information, you’re informed. When you possess knowl -  edge, you’re enlightened. The difference between being informed and being  enlightened is the difference between being able to recite something vs.  being able to teach it. 10  Do not discount the importance of being informed, however, for being  informed is a prerequisite for enlightenment. 11   This is why the practice of  taking excerpt notes is helpful. It enables one to better comprehend material.  However, excerpt notes are only a precursor for the next phase: turning the  information into knowledge by way of reformulation and reflection notes.  Within your Antinet, you’ll find a mix of knowledge and information. The  knowledge it contains isn’t fully processed until it makes its way into your  creative output.  Again, this emphasizes the point that the Antinet is a   means   to the end (the  end being creative output). The Antinet helps you process and create knowl -  edge; however the most important part is that you actually share it. As the  philosopher Hans-Georg Moeller points out, “knowledge only counts if it  is exchanged and thus given away or spent.” 12  MEANING AND THE INTRAPERSONAL NATURE OF  THE ANTINET  As we learned previously, knowledge is information multiplied by   meaning .  However, we never addressed the concept of meaning. The question is,   where  does meaning come from?  According to Alberto Cevolini, “The only operations that can reproduce and  manage   meaning   are communication and consciousness.” 13   The nature of the  10   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev. and updated  ed (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 11.  11   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev. and updated  ed (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 11.  12   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press,  2011), 108.  13   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early
376      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  communication experience (with your own past self ’s consciousness) that  arises in the course of working with an Antinet helps create   meaning . It helps  you transform information into knowledge that you can share with the world.  Knowledge development is a fluid process that transitions through different  states. From complex to simple, and back to complex again. The nature of  this process is what we’ll cover next.  COMPLEXITY TO SIMPLICITY  TO COMPLEXITY  Even though I refer primarily to   reading   throughout this book, what I’m  really referring to is more broad. I’m really referring to any   communication  experience . Any time you engage with a   source   of knowledge, you’re under -  taking a communication experience. As the scholar, Alberto Cevolini states,  “Knowledge is socially managed through   communication , although at least  one consciousness is required to perpetuate communication.” 14   The source  of the communication experience can be a book, podcast, YouTube video,  research paper, lecture, one-on-one meeting, group meeting, or any other  communication media.  When you engage with a source of knowledge, you’re undergoing a process,  making a complex entity simple, in order to then convert it back into com -  plexity—your own complexity—your Antinet (see following page).  In the first part, there’s the   author of a given text . The author has spent time  forming thoughts and presenting them to you. The thoughts often make  sense in the author’s mind; yet, the knowledge contained may indeed be  complex. It pulls from many experiences and refers to material from different  areas the author has engaged with throughout his or her life. If the author  has done a good job, they package their complex knowledge into a book that  presents the complex ideas in a simplified way.

377 K NOWLEDGE   D EVELOPMENT     complex knowledge is what composes a book. When you read a book, the  book   communicates   with   you .  Under the diagram of the character of   you , you’ll find a dotted line with the  term   communication   next to it. The dotted line refers to the communication  that takes place in your mind while you are reading. While you’re reading  you think of keyterms and thoughts stored in your Antinet. This is the  communication experience the dotted line is referring to.  Next, there’s a phase that occurs wherein you must   simplify   the material  enough to   comprehend   it. You then must   select   from the material the thoughts  you find irresistible. With the knowledge that you   select   you then add your  own   complexity   by transforming it into notes. The Antinet stores an associa -  tive chain of this complexity, which   you   then can communicate with forever.  The communication experience that you have with the Antinet is a bit sim -  pler than reading a book, in part because you’ve written it down by hand.
378      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  As a result, you process the information in a slower, more deliberate way.  You make that information more comprehendible later on. Why? Because  you’ve written it out in your own words.  The entire process involves a phase transformation between   complexity  and   simplicity .  One scholar observes the following of Luhmann’s system: “The outcome is  the reproduction of complexity by means of selection, that is, the paradoxical  reproduction of complexity through a reduction of complexity.” 15  Essentially, you simplify a book’s contents by selecting and extracting its  most irresistible parts. Then, you create knowledge by adding your own  reformulations   or   reflections   of that content. In turn, you add your own expe -  riences and ways of viewing the world. You then   install   that knowledge in  the Antinet, thereby creating a   complex   entity that you can communicate  with perennially.  Luhmann confirms this cycle, stating: “In a way, the [Antinet Zettelkasten]  is a reduction to build complexity.” 16  ROBERT BOYLE’S KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT  PROCESS  Robert Boyle’s knowledge development process is similar to what I’ve just  outlined. Boyle specifies three elementary steps that can be extrapolated  to the Antinet. 17  The first step is “careful   selection   of materials.” That is, carefully selecting  books worth reading.  15   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 27.  16   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 22.  17   Richard Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices   (Brill, 2016), 142.
379 K NOWLEDGE   D EVELOPMENT     Second in Boyle’s process: “Repeated reflection on key themes.” In other  words, figuring out what to select, and extract onto cards.  Third is: “Rehearsal of a skeletal direction of meditation.” By this, Boyle means  reviewing and doing maintenance rehearsal on the cards you’ve created.  Boyle’s process is similar to the model we’ll use in this section. Our model  has four phases, which I’ll introduce to you shortly. But first, let’s talk   analog  vs. digital   with regards to knowledge development.  ANALOG VS. DIGITAL KNOWLEDGE  DEVELOPMENT  One of the reasons the analog component of the Antinet is so important is  because of how it affects knowledge development.  To put it simply, knowledge development is different for analog systems  and digital systems. The very same principles I teach in this book cannot be  perfectly copied to digital workflows, in part because of the time investment  analog systems require. The time it takes to slow your mind down and record  your thoughts is a hidden advantage of analog systems.  To illustrate this, it’s helpful to view knowledge development by revisiting  the input-output model (shown previously):
380      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  In the   input phase   of an analog workflow, it takes more time to ingest infor -  mation. With the   priming   practice I’ll be teaching you, you’ll spend more  time actually engaging with the sources you select. However, as a result,  you’ll be reading less sporadically. With digital workflows, readers navigate  sporadically from article to article. Even with a digital e-reader like a Kindle,  one ingests information more rapidly than they do when reading physical  materials. With bookmarking tools you simply click a button on any web  page you visit to remind yourself to read something later. As a result you  end up collecting way more material in less time. As you’ll soon find out,  this isn’t a good thing.  Now, let’s consider the   processing phase . “Information processing is the  fundamental activity of the brain,” Steven Pinker writes. 18   When it comes  to processing information, the tradeoff of analog vs. digital is very much  the same as the input phase. Analog workflows take more time and energy  to process inputs. It takes more time to actually write notes by hand. It’s a  deliberate process that requires the mind to slow down and think. You think  with your pen forming thoughts across the paper. With digital, it’s faster—  especially if you know how to type without looking down at the keyboard!  As a result, you are able to create significantly more notes. In brief, a greater  quantity of notes can be written in less time with digital systems.  To recap, digital systems allow you to ingest more information and process  more information in less time. However, a great paradox occurs. You see,  there is another variable we didn’t mention in the previously model. That  variable is   quality .  Sure, digital systems enable the ingesting and processing of a greater quan -  tity of information. However they also result in lower quality ingestion and  processing of information. Because analog workflows take more time to  absorb and comprehend information, you must be much more selective  about what you read. In addition, you will be more selective in   how you  pay attention   while you read. The analog workflow also forces you to be  selective in what you choose to process. Because analog takes more time,  18   Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works, Norton pbk (New York: Norton, 2009), 83.
381 K NOWLEDGE   D EVELOPMENT     you are less tempted to create useless notes and are more incentivized to  say more with fewer words. As a result, a paradox emerges. Analog systems  enable users to produce more output in less time. Furthermore, the quality  of the   output   is higher.  This effect derives from several factors. First off, you create less trash in  analog systems. Because of the time and energy investment required for  ingesting and processing information, there’s less trash as a result. In turn  this helps during the creation process. It’s much easier to create more  with less. The reason for this is that notes act largely as   cues . They stamp  knowledge onto your mind, allowing your mind to run with it during the  creation process.  For instance, in writing this section right now, the only   cue   I had was a note -  card of the diagram shown previously. Everything else consisted simply of  me typing my explanation of the diagram. All I needed was a diagram of this  idea to serve as a cue for me to write and explain this model.  In addition, stumbling upon the card of the diagram was a structured  accident. While writing another section of this book, I stumbled upon  the model. When I happened upon it, I set it aside for the knowledge  development chapter.  Had I been using a digital workflow, this type of material would have been  crowded out by a colossal number of other digital notes. In turn, I might  not have even written about this model at all. And even if I had, I would  probably have had less time and energy to write about it because more  time would have been spent parsing the mountain of digital notes I had.  It may seem contradictory, but with analog systems, your energy is stored  and saved for the actual process of writing. With analog, you’ve spent more  time producing fewer notes such that, when it comes time to write, it’s like  being shot out of a cannon.  The section you’re reading right now is a little over eight hundred words. It  took me about a half-hour to write. This serves as an example of the analog  workflow:   more content written, in less time, and at higher quality . This is why
382      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  the analog nature of the Antinet is so important. It served as a critical piece  that helped Luhmann become “a publication machine.” 19  THE FOUR PHASES OF  KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT  I like to think of knowledge development as consisting of four phases.  The first phase is   selection . This pertains to selecting irresistible pieces of  information found while engaging with external sources (books, podcasts,  videos, etc.). Selection takes place in your own mind. It involves the internal  voice in your head. You, and only you, can decide which information is worth  selecting. It’s an incommunicable process that involves your consciousness  and self-awareness. It is indistinguishable from the concept of attention. 20  It requires being in tune with your own internal experience.  19   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

383 K NOWLEDGE   D EVELOPMENT     The second phase is   extraction . This encompasses the actual action of writ -  ing down the thoughts and observations you have while reading. There are  several workflows to choose from in this phase.  The third phase is   creation . This describes the process of creating notes. This  mean either   excerpting   notes,   reformulating   notes, or elaborating on the notes  by   reflecting   on ideas.  The fourth phase is   installation . This describes both   where   to install the cards  you’ve just created, and   how   to actually install them. This relates to the index  keyterms you will assign (if any).  In the following chapters, we’ll explore each of these phases in detail. Let’s go.  Press, 2014), 26.

But that’s  not enough: You have to have a temperament to grab ideas and do sensible things.  Most people don’t grab the right ideas or don’t know what to do with them .”  –Charlie Munger 21  I t could be argued that selection   is   the most   important process when  working with an Antinet.  Fiona McPherson, a cognitive scientist specializing in the study of notetaking,  agrees that the “most crucial” part of notetaking revolves around   selection .  Specifically this means selecting what information is important, and just as  critically,   not selecting information that is not important . 22  This introduces the tradeoff between   selection   and   exclusion . “To select every -  thing would mean to exclude nothing,” as the scholar Alberto Cevolini puts  it. Or, as Jeremias Drexel (1581—1638) puts it, “to read without selecting  means to be negligent.” 23  21   Charles T. Munger, Poor Charlie’s Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger,  Expanded Third Edition, ed. Peter D.

385 S ELECTION     In brief, the relationship between what to select and what to exclude from what  you read is an important skill—a skill which we will discuss in this chapter.  SELECTION IN THE BRAIN  I like the illustration given by cognitive scientist William K. Estes who  posited that human memory can be likened to a computing system. A com -  puting system takes inputs, runs them through a process, and then produces  outputs. 24   Here’s a diagram of how it works:  External data comes from the environment. It’s essentially the world, the  ecosystem we encounter.  Our   sensory system   consists of our senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell,  and balance. Our sensory system operates like an   interpreter   as understood  in the context of the computer language Python. The interpreter deciphers  the input data and transforms it into   information   that the computer can  24   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory. (New York: Oxford University  Press, 2014), 25.
386      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  understand. With our sensory system, it’s much the same. It deciphers the  data and turns it into information our brains can understand.  From there the brain must make a decision: is the information   meaningful  or is it   not meaningful ? If the information is not meaningful we ignore it.  We do not pay attention to it. If it is meaningful we   select   that informa -  tion. With that information selected we run it through another process.  We determine to what   degree   the item is meaningful.  The study of this process is actually what ended up motivating the devel -  opment of the science of information processing models. 25   This decision  between meaningful and non-meaningful information is indistinguishable  from the concept of   attention . 26   Brought back to the process of working with  an Antinet, when you are reading, it’s an active process that requires full  attention. The concept of selection is entrenched in this process.  THE TROUBLE OF SELECTION: FEEDBACK  Here,   selection   refers to the entire process of thinking that takes place in your  mind when you encounter a new idea. It refers to the process involved in  determining what   thought   generated by a text should be (1)   extracted   onto  a card by writing it out by hand to ruminate on or elaborate on; (2)   stored  in the Antinet by installing it in the position most similar and most closely  associated with it; or (3)   discarded   entirely because it’s not worth the time  investment of extracting or storing the thought.  This process occurs very quickly in the mind. It’s also not trivial. Consider  what Alberto Cevolini observes: “Troubles arise when one wonders about  the criteria according to which one should select, store, or discard.” 27  25   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory. (New York: Oxford University  Press, 2014), 26.  26   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory. (New York: Oxford University  Press, 2014), 26.  27   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 31.
387 S ELECTION     The notion of   troubles arising   with regard to the information one should select  or not select while reading is echoed by other scientists. Cognitive scientist,  Fiona McPherson, holds selection as the most critical skill you can master.  It is the foundation upon which others skills rest. Yet “no-one has yet to  come up with an effective way of teaching this skill,” observes McPherson.  However, there is some good news: what McPherson meant is that there’s  no universal one-size-fits-all way of teaching this. Each person will pick up  the skill of selection in a different way. It is a skill that can indeed be taught.  However, certain people may require more practice than others. 28  Developing the skills of selection requires one thing:   feedback .  Feedback equals growth. In a classroom setting, you can quickly tell how  well your notetaking is working from the feedback you receive in form of  test scores. Yet in creative work with long timelines (like one or two years),  feedback is a bit more difficult to receive in a timely manner. Sönke Ahrens  makes such an observation in his book   How to Take Smart Notes . “The  linear model of academic writing comes with few feedback opportunities,”  Ahrens writes. 29   Yet he makes an interesting assertion that, by choosing to  reformulate or reflect on your reading, you’re essentially testing yourself on  whether or not you understand the material well enough to explain it in your  own words. You’re testing yourself to see if you even know it well enough to  reformulate the material. You’re also testing yourself whenever you attempt  to write a reflection note. Do you truly understand it well enough that you’ll  be able to reflect on what you’ve selected?  However, receiving feedback is tricky when it comes to   selection . Whenever  you attempt to write notes on something, you receive feedback on how well  you understand the material. Yet, this does not provide feedback on whether  or not you should have selected the material in the first place.  28   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 13.  29   Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing,  Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers (North  Charleston, SC: CreateSpace, 2017), 54.
388      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The question is:   How do we gain feedback from the notes we create?  One argument is to just publish your notes. In other words, create a so-called  ‘digital garden’ or a personal website which shares your notes so that others  can provide feedback. Not surprisingly, this is something I do not advise for  a number of reasons. In brief, when you publish your notes, you’re publishing  information. This is less useful to people than publishing knowledge. With  knowledge, you’ve contextualized and further processed that information.  As a result your knowledge provides the reader with much more value than  unprocessed information. In turn, if you do indeed receive feedback from  such notes, the feedback will be misguided. To a large degree, it will be a  waste of time, which is why I advise against it.  In sum, perhaps there are no shortcuts here. The best way to select material is  to do so with a clear understanding of why you’re reading the source you’ve  selected. It also requires that you have a clear understanding of your audience.  I’ll offer a few suggestions for getting better at   selection :  First, create a profile of your dream reader. Search photos online and cut  out a stock photo of him or her. Paste the image on a notecard and write  down a made-up name for the person. They’re your dream reader, your  dream avatar whom you wish to serve. Ideally, create a male and female  avatar (unless you’re specifically targeting a gender). Write down a one-  to-three sentence profile on them, detailing what their interests are, what  they like, or dislike, etc. Heck, your avatar could even be your professor if  you’re a student. Place the picture(s) on your wall or some place you’ll see  regularly. Whenever you’re reading a book, read with your dream reader in  mind. This is another reason why it’s helpful to adopt a   contribution   mindset  (as opposed to a personal   growth   mindset).  Second, I recommend publishing short pieces of your work or material as  you’re writing. Instead of publishing under-processed notes, I recommend  that you give readers chapter samples and tastes of your writing. Do this by  publishing short pieces or blog posts online. This is something I’ve done  myself over the course of writing this book.
389 S ELECTION     Later, I’ll be introducing you to something called   priming , which promotes  more effective reading. You’ll end up selecting information aligned with  why   you’ve set out to read a book.  “Selection is a highly personalized activity,” writes scholar, Alberto Cevoli -  ni. 30   In other words, every person is unique, and everyone will spot unique  material that speaks to them. Your job is to channel your internal voice and  select the material that uniquely resonates with you, plain and simple.  Selection doesn’t just mean “gathering,” it means “making a judgement.” 31  However, what then follows is the question of what you should even make  a judgement about! From here, we can rely on the wisdom of early modern  literature:   select only what is considered to be of future utility . 32   That is, select  what will be of future utility to you, and through you, what will be of future  utility to others.  Selection helps form the uniqueness of your second mind. If you fit an entire  library into your Antinet, it would demolish the unique personality you’ve  injected into it by way of   selection . Digital apps like   Pocket   or   Read Later   or  Evernote   do not create a second mind. They are mere repositories of quotes,  articles, and material from others. As scholar, Richard Yeo holds, a second  mind is   selected material   (from books, a library, articles, etc.) that you capture  through creating notes which then are installed in your Antinet. This entity  works in tandem with your internal biological memory to create an internal  dialogue, and what results serves as your second mind. 33  You don’t want your Antinet to embody characteristics of just any library.  Rather, you want it to be a   personal   library. As one scholar observes, one of  30   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 4.  31   Helmut Zedelmaier, Christoph Just Udenius and the German Ars Excerpendi around 1700:  On the Flourishing and Disappearance of a Pedagogical Genre (Brill, 2016), 84.  32   Alberto Cevolini, Storing Expansions: Openness and Closure in Secondary Memories  (Brill, 2016), 186.  33   Richard Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices   (Brill, 2016), 130.
390      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  the most impressive aspects of the process in building an Antinet is that it  builds   a universal personal library out of a universal library . 34   “Such re-arising  of the world (of learning) inside the world (of learning),” Alberto Cevolini  writes, “ is possible through selection , and in turn selection is the crucial oper -  ation for begetting   complexity , that is, an excess of possible combinations,  links, or references among meaningful data.” 35  Think of it like this:   reality   is equal to all data in the cosmos.   Science   is the  study of reality. Yet science proceeds very slowly and selectively in advancing  our understanding of reality. We extract only strands of reality and do our  best to provide theories and experiments that clearly explain this slice of  reality. Luhmann makes mention of science and reality never being   whole .  They’re never equal. Why? Because science proceeds “ selectively , because  this is the only way to bring order and comprehensibility.” 36  In brief, you don’t want all the data in the universe in your Antinet. Nor do  you want tools that bring you closer to this non-ideal maximum. Digital  tools have the tendency to do just that. They have the tendency to create  overselection   (something I’ll cover shortly). You simply want to select the  most important information from the sources you engage.  As Fiona McPherson writes, “Anything that helps you select the most import -  ant information is good.” 37   Only you, yourself, can determine what strategy  works best for you in selecting material that resonates with you.  In the next chapter I’ll teach you some different   extraction methods , which  will make selecting material easier for you. But until then, let’s continue our  journey through   The Matrix   (that is,   selection ).  34   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 29.  35   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 29.  36   “ZK I: Zettel 28,4,8c—Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,” accessed August 14, 2021,   https://  niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_1_NB_28-4-8c_V .  37   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 13.
391 S ELECTION     SELECTION UNDERLIES COMMUNICATION  Communication   was a critically important area in Luhmann’s research; likewise,  for the Antinet, it also stands as a critical component. We’ll detail the concept  of communication later in this book. However, for now, it’s interesting to  note one peculiar thing involving Luhmann’s concept of communication:  it’s founded on   selection .  According to Luhmann, communication is an   emergent   reality that emanates  from three different   selections : (1) selection of information, (2) selection of  the message of this function, and (3) selective understanding (or misunder -  standing) of the message and its interpretation. 38  The concept of   selection   is critically important pragmatically, as well as the -  oretically, for the Antinet. For this reason, we shall spend time on both the  theoretical and practical matters of selection.  KNOWLEDGE SELECTION AS  NATURAL SELECTION  In natural selection, the environment essentially   selects   organisms that have  qualities that are best adapted for it to survive and reproduce. The process  of selecting information and turning into knowledge is not much different. 39  The first step in   knowledge selection   is actually   information selection . Knowledge  is created from information. As found in nature, reproduction (generally)  involves an individual selecting a mate with corresponding genetic infor -  mation. With an Antinet, you select information from   sources   that you read.  The   sources   are analogous to a mating partner.  Selected information is then processed into knowledge by reformulating  or reflecting on the information, to which you add your own experiences  and understanding, anchored by your own unique perspectives (and the  context in which you’ve experienced life). When you create a reformula -  tion note or reflection note, you essentially create a new entity altogether:  38   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 28.  39   Cf. Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works, Norton pbk (New York: Norton, 2009), 169ff.
392      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  you create knowledge. In evolutionary terms, you give birth to a child—a new,  living organism (after exchanging information in the form of genetic code).  In knowledge-science terms, you give birth to a book or other creative work  (after exchanging information in the form of reading other authors’ works).  Your (intellectual) environment is populated by your audience of readers.  If the knowledge you create (your book) resonates with your audience  exceptionally well, it will be selected. It will be selected apart from other  competing books, to rise in popularity and essentially reproduce.  For your work to survive, it doesn’t necessarily need to be the best ever.  It doesn’t necessarily need to be the most   optimal   piece of work. Rather  it must be sufficiently better than the other pieces of work competing  for your reader’s attention. In turn, your work will rise in popularity and  reproduce itself.  This highlights some important points:  1.   The success of the knowledge you produce is very much a function of:  (a) the source material you select. This means the books, articles, podcasts,  lectures, videos, or other media you select; (b) what genes (or ideas) that  you select from your mate (or book); and (c) how you then process that  information and its genes to produce a new creation (a baby, or a book);  and (d) how you then organize that creation (by deciding where to file  it, or how to raise it).  2.   The output of this process that is best adapted to its audience of readers  (that is, its environment), will survive and reproduce more successfully  than less adapted output.  THE LEVELS OF SELECTION  The Antinet can be thought of as a system containing   relations of relations of  relations . Encompassed in this model are three levels of selection: (1) selecting  what source to engage with (choosing what books to read), and (2) selecting  what material to extract, and (3) selecting where in the Antinet to install  and link to the selection(s).
393 S ELECTION     Let’s explore each of these levels of selection now.  SOURCE SELECTION  Before embarking upon the process of determining which material to select  from the books you read, there is an even more critical challenge: selecting  which books are even worth reading in the first place!  As the Catholic intellectual, Antonin Sertillanges writes, the process of  selection is prepended with an important stage: “to choose books and to  choose   in   books.” 40  40   OP A. G. Sertillanges, The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods, trans.  Mary Ryan, Reprint edition (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America  Press, 1992), 150. Emphasis added.
394      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Here are some guidelines for selecting which books to read in the first place.  These guidelines are not set-in-stone rules. Nor are they comprehensive; yet,  I think they’re helpful enough to keep in mind as a guideline for selecting books.  Guideline #1: Do Not Trust Bestsellers  with Catchy Titles  “ Do not trust interest[ing] advertising and catchy titles. ”  –Antonin Sertillanges 41  Even non-sponsored books on Amazon are suspect these days. Major pub -  lishers with   big idea   hardbound books produce some of the biggest horse-shit  out there. Ghost writers are behind more books than you’ll ever know. Big  publishing houses thrive on publishing crap. I’ve been behind the scenes  during this process and witnessed how it plays out. The New York Times  Best Sellers list is really a list of synthetically engineered crap.  Guideline #2: Do Not Trust Popular Channels That  Books are Advertised Through  If you heard about a book because the author was featured on a popular  podcast, be suspicious. Such authors are backed by a publishing house.  They’re backed by a public relations circuit that swaps in their latest fig -  urehead. I know this because (again) I’ve been behind the scenes and have  seen it firsthand. In some cases, there’s a lot of pressure for show-hosts to  accept guests, regardless of their quality. Why? First, shows need content.  Second, the publishing house probably did the show-host “a solid” recently.  For instance, a publishing house may have gotten a movie star on their show  recently during the star’s book tour of their memoir. The show-host may then  feel a sense of obligation to return the favor. How do they return the favor?  By saying yes to whichever guest the publishing house proposes to feature  on their next show (regardless of guest quality). The guest then proceeds  to hype-up whatever new (rehashed) book they’re launching.  41   OP A. G. Sertillanges, The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods, trans. Mary  Ryan, Reprint edition (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press,  1992), 150.
395 S ELECTION     Guideline #3: Go to The Original Source  “The majority of writers only edit and publish other writers’ thoughts,”  Sertillanges writes. “Read only those books in which leading ideas are  expressed at   first hand .” 42  When you read this book, you are reading the first-hand account of the  Antinet. You are reading of my experiences building an analog knowledge  machine—a second mind—using the principles of Niklas Luhmann’s Antinet.  My primary source   is the   primary source ( Communication with Noteboxes ).  Yet I’m not just regurgitating his paper. I’m sharing my knowledge and my  first-hand experiences in developing knowledge with such a system. You’re  reading about my experiences from thousands of hours of using the system.  You’re learning my nuances and ways of teaching the system. You’re reading  the primary source of the Antinet.  Many books are secondary sources. They’re merely edited curations of the  primary source. This includes books like   The Complete Idiots Guides . Don’t read  these books. Read a Wikipedia article instead. Do your own research. Soon,  you’ll spot recurring themes and sources that are regularly cited. These are  the original sources, the primary sources. Go to these sources. They’re a must.  Of course, secondary sources can be helpful as well. Specifically, they can be  helpful in spotting   how   the secondary sources got certain things right and  certain things wrong. In addition, the secondary sources may point out the  things you missed when reviewing the primary source(s).  Secondary sources are also useful in helping you compile a repository of  frequently cited works or authors.  In my readings, there are certain thinkers who are mentioned over and over  and over. These people include Immanuel Kant, Voltaire, René Descartes,  John Locke, Francis Bacon, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, and more.  42   OP A. G.

396      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The main take-away from this guideline is this: primary sources are a require -  ment, secondary sources are not.  LINK SELECTION  Another level of selection within the Antinet is selecting   where   to connect  the idea (i.e., where to install the card within the Antinet).  Selective Relations  “ The communication with the second mind becomes fruit -  ful only at a high level of generalization, namely that of  establishing communicative   relations of relations .”  –Niklas Luhmann 43  It’s not the   relations   between notes that make the Antinet a powerful system;  rather it’s the   selective relations   that do so.  Johannes Schmidt specifically calls attention to the importance of selective  relations near the end of his paper, where he points out that the specific  readings and the material one selects from the readings are important to  the Antinet. However, what is also critical is found in Luhmann’s case with  “(selective) relations established between his notes by means of his referencing  technique.” 44   That is, you must also be selective in linking your selections  to certain cards and ideas.  Note how Schmidt encloses the word   selective   in parentheses in the passage.  He did this to call out the implicit truth that Luhmann’s links were   selective  in nature. When Luhmann used the phrase   communicative relations of rela -  tions , there was no need for him to specify that he meant   selective   relations.  43   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

397 S ELECTION     For Luhmann, relations (or links) between notes were, by nature, selective.  They were not trivial to create. They could not be bulk-applied to digital files  using templates, regular expressions (regex), and tags. Links were hard-coded  into one’s Antinet, and as previously indicated, they were neuroimprinted  onto one’s mind. This network of highly selective links is a result of the ana -  log nature of the system, the benefit of which we touched on in the analog  chapter of this book.  In other words, the magic of the Antinet doesn’t revolve around   links . Rather  it involves being very   selective   in what you link cards to. Whenever you  install a card in the Antinet, you link by (1) chaining or connecting the card  behind another card, and (2) using remotelinks. Due to the analog nature  of the Antinet, you are forced to be very selective about what you link to,  and to think hard about where a card ought to go, before installing it. With  digital notetaking apps, it’s simple. You simply start typing in words for  tags or wikilinks. The tool then begins auto-populating terms you can link  to. Before you know it, you have numerous things you’re linking to which  you otherwise wouldn’t have. With the Antinet, you’re usually choosing  one, or   maybe   two cards to link to. This creates   selective relations   instead of  an overabundance of   hyper relations . This element serves as a critical factor  in transitioning your Antinet into a   second mind , as well as allowing for  structured accidents , which I’ll detail later in the book.  A LINK IS NOT A LINK (IF IT’S A HYPERLINK)  A notecard link is hard. It’s hard-earned. It’s deliberate. It’s selective. It’s a hard  link. This is part of what inspired the term I use for linking cards. They’re  cardlinks   (because it rhymes with   hard links ).  Cardlinks are not the equivalent of hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are   not   selective.  The Antinet is based around being selective. Antinet users are selective about  (1) the books they read, (2) the material they extract from those books, and  (3) the selective links they create within the Antinet.  Cardlinks are of superior impact compared to wikilinks and hyperlinks. Dig -  ital links are whittled down by synthetic features like auto-complete, regex,  or retroactive search. Cardlinks are superior to digital links not only because
398      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  they are not diluted by bloatware. In addition, the power of cardlinks are  unleashed when you begin taking advantage of the tree structure of the Anti -  net. When you follow a cardlink in the Antinet, you’re taken down a journey  of stems, leaves and other branches of thought that are also linked together.  This results in structured accidents and surprises (like walking down the  row of a section in the library that interests you). This accidental discovery  happens in a way that is almost incommunicable. Why? Because you follow  the path that is made possible thanks to the Antinet’s tree structure.  This is a glimpse into the magic of the Antinet as a   thinking tool   and a   second  mind . The magic does not stem from just one thing alone, and it doesn’t come  about through creating trivial easy links (aka, wikilinks). It’s a combination  of the four principles of the Antinet that creates its magic:  The “special filing technique,” refers to the tree structure which unlocks  infinite internal branching . The “(selective) relations” between notes (made  possible through numeric-alpha addresses). 45   These, combined with the  index which neuroimprints keyterms on the mind. These are tied together  with the analog component of the Antinet, which forces higher quality  selections . All of these combined creates the emergent magic of the Antinet.  As Johannes Schmidt points out, this structure   demonstrates how quickly  the Antinet sets users on a path away from what one would normally deem  ordered   and   taxonomically sound . Although the Antinet’s inner logic might  appear nonsensical to an outsider, to the creator—that is, to you, the person  creating the system—the Antinet is perfectly natural and understandable. 46  Through exploration of your Antinet, you are   led away   from the original  topic and to a variety of other subjects—ones that you would not have ini -  45   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

This entire process is made possible thanks to linking not being   too easy .  It’s thanks to the nature of hard links. It’s thanks to the nature of   cardlinks .  DIGITAL CREATES OVERSELECTION  As I’ve previously illustrated, it’s not just about what material to select. It’s  also about what material   not   to select.  For this reason, tools that help you   not   select as much information (due  to the considerable time and effort required in extracting them), end up  increasing your focus. It increases one’s proficiency in selecting valuable  and irresistible material.  With digital tools, selection is trivial. It’s all-too-easy to capture, copy, paste,  write, and accumulate an abundance of digital information. This is a downside,  not a strength. This is yet another reason why analog outperforms digital.  Digital collection results in over-saturation, both in terms of material and  the information the material includes.  MATERIAL SELECTION  Thus far we’ve talked about   source selection   (i.e., what books to select for  reading). We also discussed   link selection   (where in your Antinet to install  ideas). The last level of selection concerns what material   within a book   one  should select.  The Four Quadrants of Ideas  I think it’s helpful to think of ideas falling into four quadrants. This concept  is inspired by a model introduced to me by Stephen Covey.  Covey proposes four quadrants for managing time by looking at the inter -  section of four variables:   important ,   not important ,   urgent , and   not urgent . 47  47   Stephen R.

400      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  With regards to selecting material from the books you read, I propose this  model helps tremendously. One is left with selecting   Bad Ideas ,   Good Ideas ,  Excellent Ideas , and   Irresistible Ideas .  Here’s a diagram of the model:  Let’s go through each of these now.  BAD IDEAS  Don’t select bad ideas or pay attention to them. It’s pretty simple. If the  idea is irrelevant to what you’re working on   and   if the idea isn’t even that  important, then don’t think twice about it. Even if you’re unsure, err on the  side of the idea being a waste of time. We need to move fast. Time is short.  Have the confidence that truly valuable ideas will take hold of you later on.  edition (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2020).
401 S ELECTION     GOOD IDEAS  These are ideas that could very well be timely and applicable to what you’re  working on, yet they don’t add much value. If the idea doesn’t add much  value to your project, or if the information is redundant, then forego selecting  them for your project.  For instance, I could bog myself down for a year reading scholarly literature  on the history of notetaking systems. I could fill your mind with mountains  of seemingly relevant details pertaining to early notebox systems. I could tell  you about how there’s a debate as to whether the   Josephinian catalog   of the  late 1700s was the first card catalog in library history or if Konrad Gessner’s  of the 1500s actually was. 48  But in reality, that information isn’t   that   important. The matter at hand is this:  (1) you want to know   why   the Antinet is the best knowledge development  system out there; (2) you want to know the theory behind why it’s better  than digital; (3) you want to know   how   you can build an Antinet; and (4)  you want to know what positive effects you can expect by committing to  the Antinet (surprise, creative insights, breakthroughs, etc.). You   do not  need to know every single detail about the history of notetaking. That’s for  a different book.  In brief, don’t feel the need to select material that is related to what you’re  doing, but is   not that   important. Avoid selecting good ideas. It’s OK to note  them in your mind and find them interesting and amusing, but that’s all they  deserve. A grunt of amusement.  EXCELLENT IDEAS  Deciding whether to select or ignore excellent ideas is tricky. These ideas are  important, yet they are not relevant to the project or goal you’re working on.  48 Markus Krajewski, Paper Machines: About Cards & Catalogs, 1548-1929, trans. Peter Krapp,  History and Foundations of Information Science (Cambridge, MA, USA: MIT Press, 2011),  38-9.
402      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  I realize it may be difficult, but you want to err on the side of skipping these  ideas. Granted, there’s a spectrum to the degree of   importance . If the idea  ranks at least 96 out of 100 on the   importance spectrum , it’s OK to select the  idea. 49   However, you should only   extract   the idea onto your bibcard (which  you’ll learn more about soon). You do not want to spend time   processing  these ideas by converting them into maincards (by way of   excerpt ,   refor -  mulation , or   reflection   notes). You’ll want to create an ExRef for excellent  ideas, but that’s all.  IRRESISTIBLE IDEAS  You want to spend almost all of your time living for the   irresistible ideas .  These are ideas that are both timely   and   important. Think of these as ideas  that truly resonate with you. When you encounter one of these ideas, you  simply   just know . These ideas can be something that   you (and only you)   can  see. These ideas are influenced by your own perspectives and unique expe -  riences in life (both good and bad). These ideas collide with truths you’ve  been contemplating that are reverberating in your mind. These are usually  things that only you can see and connect.  Time is scarce. This is why you shouldn’t care to bother with any of the  other quadrants. You want to reserve as much time as possible to select and  develop irresistible ideas.  Do not feel obligated to write down excellent ideas. A good chunk of them  will be relegated to good ideas in a month.   The ideas you want to write down  are the irresistible ideas .  Make Ideas Prove Themselves  Oftentimes, I’ll make an idea   prove   itself. I’ll make it prove that it’s irresistible.  For instance, I’ll read something I feel is irresistible on page 100. But I won’t  49   I like to view life through a unique value scale. I find using a pre-defined set of values sim -  plifies the complexity of life. I don’t believe in something being a 100% yes, or a 0% no. I find  that to be too dogmatic. We don’t know what we don’t know, even when we’re certain we do  know. Therefore, I like to use the following scale to value things. 4%, 20%, 50%, 80%, 96%.  This scale is inspired by the Pareto principle (the 80-20 rule). Yet it also applies a fractal of  that principle. We get 4% from 20% of 20%. We get 96% from 20% more than 80%.

I note it  in my mind and let it ruminate for some time. And then I continue reading.  By the time I get to page 150—even if it’s several days later—if I still find the  idea irresistible, I’ll extract it by writing it down on my bibcard.  What Should and Shouldn’t You Select?  One author, who, to a large degree, regurgitates Sönke Ahrens’s material,  puts forth a good question that Ahrens never answers clearly. The question  is,   What should, and shouldn’t, be noted down?  Ahrens is rather vague in answering this question, but he at least advises the  reader what   not   to do. This other author advises: don’t write down anything  you already know by heart. Yet, he qualifies this maxim by saying it’s OK to  write down something you already know—if, that is—you intend to con -  nect it to related thoughts. 50   Such advice is problematic, however, because  everything   is related to something in the cosmos. Even   nothing   can be related  by describing it. How does one describe nothing? By stating it’s   not nothing ,  and linking it to   not nothing   in your Antinet. Everything can be connected  to related thoughts by way of inversion.  In brief the advice that you shouldn’t write down anything you know by  heart—unless you wish to relate it to something else—is rather vague.  I also believe it’s too simplistic.  The question remains,   What types of things should you write down?  A better way of asking this is,   What types of material should you select while  reading?   Here’s why this is an improved question: the material you   select  doesn’t necessitate that you’ll   extract   that knowledge. You’re   selecting   material  to determine if it’s appropriate to actually extract.  So back to the question,   What types of material should you select while reading?  50   David Kadavy, Digital Zettelkasten: Principles, Methods, & Examples (Kadavy, Inc.,  2022), 30.
404      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Here’s my take:  1.   Adhere to the rule of selecting only irresistible things from your readings.  Irresistible things are those things that only you can determine. Irresistible  encompasses those things you find to be   genius , or that you find you simply  just   resonate   with in a way that’s difficult to explain in words. It must be  true. Only you can determine if something is   truly   irresistible.  2 . Select irresistible   patterns   that you’ve noticed from reading across dif -  ferent disciplines. Also select patterns you’ve noticed from your unique  life experiences.  3.   Select irresistible ideas that are brand new to you. Granted, if you’re reading  in a new field, many of the ideas you encounter will be brand new. That’s  fine. Write them down, especially if they resonate with you.  4 . Select hard or challenging ideas that you find irresistible. Say you encoun -  ter an idea that you find irresistible. Say it resonates with you. Yet, say  you find it hard or challenging to decipher. Select that material with the  expectation that you’ll be creating an   excerpt   note of it, or a   reformulation  note of it in order to better understand it.  5.   Select as if you’ll be   teaching   the material. Even if you’re in a state of mind  where you’re focused on   growing   your knowledge, adopt the mindset of  a teacher. Operate as if you’re selecting the material in order to teach the  material. This is the   contribution   state of mind. The great paradox is that  if you adopt the mindset of   contribution , you’ll experience more   growth .  When you select material as if you’ll be teaching it, you’ll focus on extract -  ing the truly helpful and insightful pieces of knowledge.  6.   Select material that deeply affects you. There may be certain passages or  compositions of prose that move you. Remember that emotions can actu -  ally be felt in the body (so pay attention to your responses to the material  you read). Fundamentally, emotions can be rolled up into five categories. 51  51   Jim Dethmer, Diana Chapman, and Kaley Klemp, The 15 Commitments of Conscious
405 S ELECTION     The five emotions are: anger, sadness, fear, joy, and creative feelings. Mate -  rial which generates deep experiences involving these emotions ought to  be selected.  Now that you know what to select, let’s address the material you should  definitely   not   select while reading.  This question is simpler. There are two types of material you should not select:  1.   Do not select information that is not irresistible. Do not select material  that is   bad ,   good , or even   excellent . If it’s not irresistible, don’t waste your  time. You’ll have barely enough time to elaborate on and develop irre -  sistible material. Why waste your life energy trying to develop less than  irresistible material? The correct answer is: you shouldn’t!  2.   Do not write something down that you’ve already written down. In the  knowledge creation   phase I’ll introduce a process that helps ensure you don’t  waste your time developing content you’ve already written down by hand.  In brief, it involves reviewing your Antinet   before   you commit to creating  a new note. The directive of not writing down something you’ve already  written down applies mainly to   excerpt   notes. Say you come across Robert  Frost’s famous poem,   The Road Not Taken   (“Two roads diverged in a yellow  wood…”). If you find that poem irresistible, yet you’ve already written  it down, then don’t write it down again! Don’t select the material again.  If you make a mistake and forget that you’ve already written it down—and  if you end up creating an excerpt note for it—make sure you install the  note in your Antinet anyway. That way, you’ll have a record of your mistake.  Remember: don’t erase mistakes! Don’t delete material in your Antinet.  Now that we have a good grasp of what material to select while reading a book,  let’s talk about one final concept before moving on: the concept of   priming .  Leadership: A New Paradigm for Sustainable Success (United States: Conscious Leadership  Group, 2015), 84ff.
406      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Priming  The process you must complete before reading even the first page of any  book is called the   priming phase . 52  The priming phase entails reading related material, relevant background  material, even dissecting the book’s table of contents, and other techniques  (for instance, designing a quiz about the book for yourself).  According to one cognitive psychologist, priming “really does help, especially  when the subject matter is difficult or unfamiliar.” 53  I have a specific process that I encourage you to do before reading any book.  It works best with a certain knowledge extraction strategy called the   Luh -  mannian bibcard method . I’ll detail that method in the next section. For this,  however, all you’ll need is a 4 x 6 inch blank white notecard.  On the front-side of the bibcard you will write three items: (1) the   bib -  liographic details   of the source, (2) your   goal   in engaging the source, and  (3) an   overview   of the source if available (i.e., a   brief   overview of its table  of contents).  This becomes your bookmark as you read the book.  Here’s a picture of one of my bibcards. The front can be thought of as the  priming   area:  52   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 2.  53   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 2.
407 S ELECTION     CREATING AN OVERVIEW  Note that the overview section isn’t a word-for-word copy of the table of  contents. It’s brief. It forces you to take the deliberate time to read the table  of contents and get a general idea of what you’re about to read.  This practice was inspired by Mortimer Adler’s classic book titled   How to  Read a Book . In this book he introduces the practice he calls X-raying a book.  He uses this analogy to illustrate that one ought to get a sense of a book’s  skeleton—its structure—before reading it.  This practice is also supported by a cognitive scientist who specializes in  notetaking. She advises that one ought to analyze a book’s table of contents  as an important first step before reading any book. 54  SETTING A GOAL  Being intentional with your reading is a game-changer, plain and simple.  Luhmann always had an intentional goal with his readings. He used short-  term projects (research papers) that enabled him to immediately apply many  54   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 3.
408      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  of his ideas, and if those ideas weren’t immediately useful, to place ExRefs  in their appropriate place to ruminate on and be used when the time came.  Luhmann published 550 research papers during his academic career. Two  hundred more papers were found among his belongings after he passed  away. This comes out to 750 papers. Let’s not even take into consideration  the seventy books he also published during this period. If we just look at  the papers, he was working on roughly two papers per month. Luhmann,  ultimately, was always reading with a specific project in mind.  As Antonin Sertillanges advises, your reading should be influenced by a  definite idea—a clear goal and purpose. “Let it take account not only of  your vocation and your personality, but of their immediate application.” 55  In other words, read specifically with an eye for   immediately applying   the  knowledge you encounter.  For the knowledge you encounter that is irresistible yet not immediately  applicable, simply create an ExRef for the material in your Antinet. In brief,  your time creating main notes—specifically   reflection notes —should be for  material that is immediately applicable.  CONCLUSION  We covered a lot of important material in this section. We outlined the  importance of taking   selection   seriously. That is, the importance of selecting  books carefully, selecting the material in them carefully, and selecting   where  to install those ideas within the Antinet carefully.  Selection is a vague and fuzzy area of knowledge development. If things are  still a bit unclear, rest assured that your selection skills will improve with  practice. Thankfully, analog knowledge development helps in this regard.  55   OP A. G. Sertillanges, The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods, trans.

409 S ELECTION     You’ll quickly learn that you’re selecting   way too much   material when it takes  you seemingly forever to get through a book!  If you only take one thing from this chapter, let it be this:   select only the most  irresistibly important books, and the most irresistibly important ideas within those  books, which are immediately applicable to your project or goal .  Now that you know about selection, it’s time to embark upon the next phase  of knowledge development:   Extraction .
410  C H A PT E R FO U RT E E N  �  EXTRACTION  T he   extraction   phase of knowledge   development concerns itself  with the actual   action   of pulling out material from the sources with  which you engage.   Selection   entails the internal experience of taking notice  of certain thoughts or ideas, after which you face a yes-or-no question. Are  you going to extract the material by writing it down?  If you determine that yes, you’re going to convert the material into a note,  you then proceed into the extraction phase. The extraction phase is a process  that exists   before   you actually create the main note. But in this phase you  actually take deliberate action by   marking   the material to be extracted. Within  this phase, there are several methods you can use to   extract   material. Before  we dive into the explicit methods, let’s first survey the different types of  strategies involved in reading a book (or engaging with a knowledge source).  INTENTIONAL VS. EXPLORATORY  STRATEGIES  Some books may require a more   intentional   extraction strategy and others  a more   exploratory   strategy.  As Antonin Sertillanges advises, “One will have recourse to other books for  information , not for   formation .” 1   In other words, when you are new to mate -  rial and you’re in the exploratory phase, you’re reading for   formation .

411 E XTRACTION     primary extraction strategy should consist of comprehending the material  you’re reading. Your content should consist of   reformulating   the material in  your own words.  Once you have developed the foundation of knowledge in a field, you can  begin reading   intentionally . You can begin looking for information to evolve  ideas. You begin looking for information that supports your current theories,  which are incubating in your Antinet. You begin reading for the purpose  of finding material that yields more granular distinctions relative to your  theories. You further elucidate these new thoughts by way of   reflection   notes.  Let’s consider both intentional extraction and exploratory extraction  in detail.  INTENTIONAL EXTRACTION  An   intentional extraction strategy   should be employed when you’re already  familiar with the material you’re reading. If you’re pressed for time, or if you  are working with a singular project in mind, you’ll also want an intentional  extraction strategy.  When reading intentionally, you’ll be reading for material to enrich your  project. The important thing here is that you do not get “bogged down,”  as Luhmann would say. 2   You want to spend less time writing down   excerpt  and   reformulation   notes, and more time writing   reflection   notes.  The two extraction methods best for this are the   2-step marginalia method ,  and the   2-step Luhmannian bibcard method . These enable you to quickly  identify material you find irresistible; but, instead of getting bogged down,  and developing them right then and there, you delay the processing. After  you’re done reading, you can determine how to efficiently process the  material. This gives you more time to elaborate on the most important  irresistible ideas.  2   “ZK II: Sheet 9/8d—Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed March 4, 2022,   https://niklas-luh -  mann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8d_V .
412      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  In the next section, we’ll cover the specific extraction methods just outlined  in more detail. Before that, however, let’s quickly cover the concept of  exploratory extraction.  EXPLORATORY EXTRACTION  An   exploratory extraction strategy   should be employed for books that are  more difficult to parse. Much of the time this applies to books in fields that  are new to you. As Mortimer Adler writes,  If you are reading in order to become a better reader, you  cannot read just any book or article. You will not improve  as a reader if all you read are books that are well within your  capacity. You must tackle books that are beyond you, or, as  we have said, books that are over your head. Only books of  that sort will make you stretch your mind. And unless you  stretch, you will not learn. 3  Let’s take an example from my own experience. Sometime back I was reading  a book called   Book of Proof . It’s an introduction to the world of mathematical  proofs (think a bunch of Greek symbols, equations, and numbers. This field  was completely new to me. I was attracted to it because of the challenge.  In order to understand the text, I had to take diligent notes. Taking notes in  margins wasn’t effective, as there was not enough space. Taking bullet point  notes on a bibcard wasn’t the best option either. On average, each of the  notes would take up an entire card anyway. It didn’t make sense to constrain  myself, or have them run across several bibcards.  The method I employed for this book was the   1-step book-to-maincard  method . This method entails stopping while reading, pulling out a note -  card and writing down the note immediately (I prefer 3 x 5 inch because  the constraints breed focus). The notes you write in this method are either  excerpts   or   reformulations . The purpose of writing these notes is to better  understand the new material. If you proceed through challenging books  3   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev. and updated ed  (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 330.
413 E XTRACTION     without first understanding the elementary material that came first, you’re  in for a difficult ride. You need to understand the elementary, fundamental  concepts before you understand the more complex concepts.  The book-to-maincard method enables you to proceed through difficult texts,  though the downside, of course, is getting bogged down. It’s counter-intuitive,  but reading using an exploratory 1-step strategy ends up taking more time  than 2-step intentional strategies.  Let’s cover the extraction methods in detail now.  KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION METHODS  With notetaking and reading, the method you use to extract knowledge is  of paramount importance.  Certain extraction methods work for reading new books with unfamil -  iar ideas, whereas they fail for other types of books. For this reason you  must “understand why and how and when” to use different extraction  methods. 4  When choosing an extraction method, it’s important that you not simply  choose the one you’re “most comfortable with.” 5   That is, don’t merely choose  a strategy that is most compatible with how you’re feeling that day. Oftentimes,  the best strategy is not the one you’re initially comfortable with. Research  supports this, as well.   6  You also should not feel obligated to be married to an extraction method  forever. You must have, at your disposal, several extraction methods to  choose from. As cognitive scientist Fiona McPherson observes, there’s  “no one ‘best’ strategy for taking notes.” 7  4   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 2.  5   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 7.  6   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 7.  7   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 7.
414      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  In my own case, I employ the   2-step Luhmannian bibcard method   the major -  ity of the time (think 96%). However, for books in fields that are com -  pletely new to me, or ones that are challenging, I sometimes use the   1-step  book-to-maincard method .  THE 1-STEP BOOK-TO-MAINCARD METHOD  The book-to-maincard method is quite simple. There’s a good chance you  already do this. You simply read a book with pen and notecards at hand.  When you come across a key concept or passage, you stop reading and make  a note for it on a dedicated card. Typically the note is either an   excerpt   (i.e.,  a word-for-word copy of the quote), or a   reformulation   of the concept in  your own words. It can also be a   reflection   note; however I find this kind of  note to be briefer than the reflection notes I create using the Luhmannian  bibcard method. Why? Because you don’t have enough time to let the idea  ruminate on a staging card (i.e., a bibcard). When writing   reflection   notes  using the book-to-maincard method, they seem to embody briefer (and less  deep) ideas. I like to think of these as   observations   (which are similar to the  concept of   bibnotes , which you’ll learn soon).  Book-to-Maincard Notes in Practice  I like to place my book-to-maincard notes on 3 x 5 inch cards. This prevents  me from getting bogged down. Typically my book-to-maincard notes are  excerpts . Limiting myself to the 3 x 5 inch space prevents me from excerpting  quotes or ideas that are too large. In addition, when using 4 x 6 inch cards  I frequently experience an unsettling urge to fill up the entire card.  If I use only a few lines, it feels much more like I’m wasting paper. Using  3 x 5 inch cards helps me avoid this feeling, and in turn, it helps me avoid  getting bogged down in a book by stopping every few pages to write out  long excerpts.  On the next page is a picture of a book-to-maincard note I took.  THE 2-STEP MARGINALIA METHOD  Marginalia   refers to making notations or other marks in the margins of the  books you read. This is something Niklas Luhmann never did.
415 E XTRACTION     One could argue that the reason Luhmann never wrote in books was  because he actually mostly read in libraries. 8   Yet Luhmann did indeed own  many books. Among his possessions were 5,000 books, 1,400 journal issues,  300 special journal issues, 1,600 offprints, and other material. Johannes  Schmidt observed that they hardly showed any underlining or margin  notes. He states, “Luhmann almost always made notes on slips of paper  while reading.” 9  Regardless, marginalia remains a popular practice. It’s a practice adhered  to by many readers and writers, including Cal Newport, Charlie Munger,  David McCullough, Ryan Holiday, and countless others. 10  8   Undisciplined, Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt, 2021, https://www.youtube.  com/watch?v=kz2K3auPLWU, 25:40; “Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,” accessed April 11, 2022,  https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/nachlass/uebersicht.  9   “Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,” accessed April 11, 2022, https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/  nachlass/uebersicht.  10   “How I Read When Researching a Book - Study Hacks—Cal Newport,” accessed  April   11,   2022,https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2017/08/14/how-i-read-when-re -  searching-a-book/; “David McCullough on Reading,” accessed April 11, 2022, http://  northmainbooknotes.blogspot.com/2017/05/david-mccullough-on-reading.html;  Ryan   Holiday,   “The   Notecard   System:   The   Key   For   Remembering,   Organizing  And Using Everything You Read,” RyanHoliday.Net (blog), April 1, 2014, https://
416      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  I’ve employed the marginalia practice, as well. However, I do not think you  should follow this practice.  Here’s why: Because marginalia suck.  Yes, marginalia suck. They suck compared to the Luhmannian bibcard  practice I’ll teach you next.  That said, I foresee many of you not believing me. You may have some sacred  scheme or practice such as making notes and dog-earing pages.  I’ve decided to at least outline the marginalia schemes available. That way you  can observe the practices I’ve found to be inferior so that you can potentially  skip having to learn the hard way yourself.  The CVP Marginalia Scheme  During the short period of time I employed a marginalia method, I used a  scheme I found quite convenient. Upon coming across a passage I found  irresistible, I would place either a C, V, or a P next to it. The C meant   Concept .  The V meant   vocab . The P meant   prose .  Whenever I read something with an irresistible   concept ,   vocab   word, or great  prose , I would note down either C, V, or P in the margin.  In the beginning this was nice. However, I encountered problems with this  method. The barrier to selecting material became too low. It was too easy  to   select   any and every thought. It resulted in my selecting way too much  material for extraction. This created an over-abundance of homework.  When reading the book   Cataloging the World , I employed this method.  As a result, the material I’ve selected from this book remains underdevel -  oped. I have indeed used material from it; however I’ve had to spend more  time developing the material. Additionally, because I never took the time to  ryanholiday.net/the-notecard-system-the-key-for-remembering-organizing-and-us -  ing-everything-you-read/.
417 E XTRACTION     deliberately process the material by writing it down by hand, I find myself  relating it to other parts of the book less frequently.  Here you can see a picture of one section of the book. Note how I placed  way too many C’s in the margin.  When you use a marginalia technique like this, you end up selecting way too  much material for extraction. That’s my experience, at least. You’re welcome  to test yourself, and learn the hard way!  The Dot Marginalia Scheme  After some time employing the CVP marginalia scheme, I began using  something I call the   dot marginalia scheme . In this method you simply read  a book, and whenever there’s an irresistible idea, you place a simple dot (·)  next to it. When you go back to read through your selections, you can usually  tell why you selected that material (i.e., whether it’s a   concept ,   vocab   term, or  prose ). Therefore, in theory, it saves time.
418      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Again, like the CVP method, it results in an overabundance of selections.  You create a ton of homework for yourself. The material you select tends to  include many   good   ideas and   excellent   ideas instead of exclusively containing  irresistible   ideas.  Here’s an example of the dot marginalia scheme. I used this while reading  the book   The Hero with a Thousand Faces .  Like the CVP marginalia scheme, this one resulted in too many selections.  The Note Marginalia Scheme  One of the more popular marginalia schemes involves writing brief notes in  the margins. These notes are typically your own thoughts and observations  that relate directly to the passage you’ve read.  I used this scheme when reading a book on memory science. Here’s a picture  from a section of the book:
419 E XTRACTION     There are several problems with this scheme. You end up selecting too  much material and you end up leaving less time for the irresistible ideas.  Furthermore you experience a tendency wherein you write too much, with  the result being that you end up wasting time. What you’ve written down  in the book must then be duplicated and written down on a note. This is  fine when using a very limited space (such as a single line on a bibcard);  however, the space in marginalia often can stretch vertically. This leaves you  more space to expand your writing. Often, what you end up writing down  in the margin is something you shouldn’t have even wasted energy writing  down in the first place.  Your Own Marginalia Scheme  As noted, I contend that the marginalia method is inferior to the Luhmannian  bibcard method. If you still insist on marking up book margins, though, then  chances are you’ll use your own marginalia scheme. I’ve observed that a lot  of people like placing little sticky notes or post-it tabs in their books. While  I don’t recommend any of this, I won’t slam you for adding your own flavor  to your knowledge extraction process. Each person is different.
420      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Since I do not recommend marginalia notes and I opt for the ultimate strategy  that Luhmann used, I’ll introduce it to you shortly.  But first, let me cover a few other extraction methods very quickly.  OTHER EXTRACTION METHODS  Cognitive scientist, Fiona McPherson, outlines three other extraction meth -  ods: (1) highlighting, (2) headings, and (3) summaries. 11   I’ll cover them now.  Highlighting and headings aren’t really pure, stand-alone, extraction meth -  ods. They’re more like pre-extraction methods. They’re essentially   selection  methods for noting which items you intend to extract. They’re used primarily  to help you   comprehend   information and then convert such information into  deeper knowledge. You convert the information into deeper knowledge by  creating a note for it and elaborating on the material.  Let’s talk about highlighting first.  HIGHLIGHTING  Highlighting   is not a good method for dense, complex, and challeng -  ing information. For that type of material it’s best to employ the 1-step  book-to-maincard method.  While highlighting does not possess the cognitive development power, it is  not “completely pointless,” as it does help you actually pay attention to the  words on the page. 12   Generally, I’d advise you to stay away from highlighting.  If the material is familiar to you, or even if it’s complicated, highlighting  won’t help much. There’s even research indicating highlighting may harm  one’s ability to learn and recall information. 13   Highlighting steals time and  energy away from more effective learning practices.  11   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 14.  12   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 17.  13   James H.

Barker Bausell and Joseph  R. Jenkins, “Effects on Prose Learning of Frequency of Adjunct Cues and the Difficulty
421 E XTRACTION     As one cognitive scientist observes, the main value of highlighting does  not intrinsically add much value to your understanding of the material; its  benefit (if any) stems from   its ability to motivate you to spend more time with  the material . Yet as we’ve found, writing by hand and spending the time elab -  orating on material by writing reflection notes is even more motivating and  fun—especially if you’re only elaborating on the material you find irresistible.  In brief, I’d recommend you stop the practice of highlighting.  HEADINGS  Headings that you write   are brief sentences outlining what the following  paragraph intends to cover. They do not summarize or spoil what is written  in the paragraph; rather they help organize its content.  Headings have been shown to produce better summaries, outlines, and  reformulation of material. This in turn helps enhance your recall of the  material you read. 14  Headings are classified as   organizational signals , and have demonstrated a  tendency to improving a reader’s recall of information (unlike highlighting). 15  Headings are usually provided in texts whose author is awesome (like  me), and who put the work in to organize their material into chunks with  a heading attached.  However, so-called “learned” authors (scientists and scholars, like Luhmann)  may forgo such niceties. In such a case it may be a useful practice to create  your own headings. I don’t recommend doing this directly in the book (i.e.,  marginalia). Rather, I recommend using your bibcard for this practice.  of the Material Cued,” Journal of Reading Behavior 9, no. 3 (September 1, 1977): 227–32;  John Dunlosky et al., “Improving Students’ Learning With Effective Learning Techniques:  Promising Directions From Cognitive and Educational Psychology,” Psychological  Science in the Public Interest 14, no. 1 (January 1, 2013): 4–58.  14   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 35.  15   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018),  35-6.
422      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The third extraction method is that of   summaries . This is analogous to creating  a   reformulation   note, which is covered in detail in the next chapter. These are  best for tackling difficult material. If tackling difficult material, I recommend  creating reformulation notes using the 1-step book-to-maincard method.  In brief, you go straight from book to creating an entire notecard dedicated  to reformulating the difficult idea you just read.  Let’s now turn to the grand-daddy of all the extraction strategies: the   two-  step Luhmannian bibcard method .  THE TWO-STEP LUHMANNIAN BIBCARD METHOD  A phase transition took place in the eighteenth century during the enlighten -  ment wherein the reading styles of scholars changed. “An enlightened reader  was no longer supposed to collect and memorize ‘factoids’ that he found in  the texts of others,” observed scholar, Fabian Krämer. 16   In the sixteenth and  seventeenth centuries, when scholars read, their focus centered on   collecting  bits of knowledge   (excerpting). During the enlightenment, scholars began to  read by recording their own thoughts (observations). 17   Essentially, reading  and observing became “closely intertwined.” 18   The observations one made  while reading could then be used to process an idea more fully. This could  be done by way of (1) creating reflection notes on the material in order to  integrate ideas into one’s own theories and creative work, (2) testing an  author’s conclusions by way of experiment, and (3) writing critical reviews  of books (which became a popular practice during the enlightenment).  These deeper ways of processing texts begins with recording one’s   observa -  tions . The container with which one records such observations is that of the  bibcard . This is what we’ll be covering in this section.  In the course of using the Antinet, I’ve tried out all of the methods mentioned  previously. I’ve come to conclude that the best method in the majority of  cases is what you’re about to learn now:   The 2-step bibcard method .  16   Fabian Krämer, Albrecht von Haller as an ‘Enlightened’ Reader-Observer (Brill, 2016), 224.  17   Fabian Krämer, Albrecht von Haller as an ‘Enlightened’ Reader-Observer (Brill, 2016), 233.  18   Fabian Krämer, Albrecht von Haller as an ‘Enlightened’ Reader-Observer (Brill, 2016), 241.
423 E XTRACTION     In Luhmann’s first Antinet, he primarily adopted the 1-step book-to-maincard  method. As Johannes Schmidt observes, “the early notes from the 1950s  and 1960s frequently tended to be more of the running-text kind and more  closely reflected the original readings.” 19  In Luhmann’s second Antinet, his method changed.  Here’s an overview of this process:  This method entails extracting knowledge from external sources by placing  it on a bibcard.  On the front-side of the bibcard, are three items: (1) the   bibliographic details  of the source, (2) your   goal   in engaging the source, and (3) an   overview   of  19   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution  in Early Modern Europe 53 (2016), 292-3.
424      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  the source if available (such as a brief overview of its table of contents). This  is already covered in the chapter on   selection .  On the back-side of the bibcard, are the bibnotes. The bibnotes are the  observations   you have while reading. These are the internal thoughts and  ideas you wish to select from the material. With these items, you’ll either:  (1) convert them into main notes by excerpting them, reformulating them,  or reflecting on them, or (2) forego elaborating on the items by storing them  as ExRefs. By foregoing elaboration, you allow the items to ruminate until  the time wherein you’re working on a relevant project which will benefit  from including the material.  Here’s a picture of a bibcard:
425 E XTRACTION     How to Read with a Bibcard  Reading using the bibcard method typically involves three items: (1) a  physical book, (2) a pen, and (3) the bibcard.  Ideally I recommend physical books (as opposed to reading digital versions).  For almost a decade, I read with a Kindle; however a few years ago I transi -  tioned back to using physical books because I felt a stronger spiritual, even  sacred, connection to physical books. Reading physical books also seemed  more effective in helping me comprehend what I was reading. Research  now backs my observations. Recently, a scientific study found that “reading  comprehension is reduced when reading from an electronic device.” 20  The bibcard method works better with physical books than digital books.  You simply place the bibcard in any location at the back of the book. When  you finish your reading session, place it where you left off, using the bibcard  as a bookmark.  In addition, you’ll want a pen available at the ready. I like to clip the pen  onto the back cover of the book.  Here’s how it looks:  20   Motoyasu Honma et al., “Reading on a Smartphone Affects Sigh Generation, Brain  Activity, and Comprehension,” Scientific Reports 12, no. 1 (January 31, 2022): 1589.
426      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Inside the book you’ll see the bibcard, which acts as a bookmark, and clipped  onto the book’s back cover is a pen.  I’ve tried a lot of reading setups. A lot of them have pluses and minuses. Cer -  tain ones are fine; however, in unusual situations, like while reading in bed or  on a sandy beach, they fail miserably. For instance, reading with a Moleskine  notebook while lying in bed isn’t something that works for most people.  With the bibcard reading method, one can read in bed on their back right  before falling asleep and still have everything they need to extract a key idea.  Reading outdoors is also more supported by physical books. Luhmann once  said, “I like working in the sun.” 21   For those who like reading outside, this is  also a great setup because it requires minimal supplies and isn’t subject to  the limitations some screens have when used in bright direct light.  Here’s a photo of Luhmann reading in the sun using this method. Note what  looks like a bibcard sticking out of the book.  photo credit :  Niklas Luhmann—  Theory of Society  4_13 by Schwumbel;  philomag, “Niklas  Luhmann Und  Die Aufrichtigkeit,”  Philosophie Magazin,  accessed April 26,  2022, https://www.  philomag.de/artikel/  niklas-luhmann-und-  die-aufrichtigkeit.  Bibnotes  A bibnote is what Sönke Ahrens refers to as a   literature note , even though it  doesn’t make sense to call them literature notes (as that indicates the notes are  21   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 31.
427 E XTRACTION     from literature). For several reasons, I prefer the term   bibnote . A bibliography  is a collection of the works you cite in your research, it’s not just composed of  literature. The notes one takes can certainly be from a medium beyond liter -  ature. You can take notes from YouTube videos, lectures, podcasts, you name  it. Furthermore, it can be argued that readers should not confine themselves  to reading only literature. In the words of John Aubrey, a fellow of the Royal  Society, “material gathered should not be confined to that offered in books.” 22  Since the notes you take while engaging with your sources emanate from your  “bibliography” (your list of references), I like to refer to these notes as bibnotes.  Bibnotes are made in bullet-point format. The briefer they are, the better.  They begin with a page number in parentheses, and then list out the thought  or observation.  For instance, here’s a bib -  card with bibnotes I took  while listening to a podcast.  note : I put timestamps  of the ideas in parantheses.

428      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  I like to think of the nature of these individual bibnotes as   observations .  They’re observations that you have as you engage with a   source . By source  I mean a book, podcast, lecture, YouTube video, etc.  John Locke’s notes were of kindred nature and were referred to as “obser -  vation” notes. The scholar, Richard Yeo, refers to them as “short comments  connected with books [Locke] was reading.” 23  Much of the time your bibnotes don’t even have to be a short comment.  They can be condensed even more by simply writing a keyterm.  As Johannes Schmidt observes, bibnotes are “not simply excerpts,” and that  Luhmann “jotted down only a few keywords in the course of his reading  along with the respective page numbers.” 24  I do the same by simply writ -  ing a page number down, and  then the keyterm. I signal it’s  a keyterm by underlining it.  For instance, see this bibcard:  23   Richard Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices   (Brill, 2016), 149.  24   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

429 E XTRACTION     The bibnote (27) Zone of Genius signals to me that on page 27, there is  material relating to the concept of sticking within your “Zone of Genius.”  In other words, sticking with your core competency and focusing on your  gifts. Because   Zone of Genius   is underlined, it indicates that it’s a keyterm  pertaining to a core idea, which already has an entry in my index box.  Here is a picture of page 27 in   The Intellectual Life :  When I thought of the keyterm   Zone of Genius , it was in regards to the idea  that one should not “aim at what is beyond their powers, and thus run the
430      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  risk of falling into error, [and of those]   who waste their real capacity in order  to acquire some capacity that is illusory …” 25  In this instance, I didn’t have immediately relevant use for this idea, and  therefore I didn’t develop a maincard for it. Instead, I created an ExRef.  Here’s a picture of it in the area of my Antinet pertaining to   Zone of Genius .  Within this area there’s a card of   Zone-of-Genius-related   ExRefs:  The concept of   Zone of Genius   is important to me; yet I decided it’s not  immediately applicable to my current project—that project being the book  you’re reading right now. I mean,   Zone of Genius   technically   could be   relevant  to this book, and I could dedicate a section of the book to it (which I guess,  indirectly I’m kind of doing right now). However, you have to draw a line  in the sand and focus on the most pertinent material for your task at hand.  And right now, we have our hands full enough with the material covered  in this book. Simply creating an ExRef allows me to delay processing until  I have use for it (which will probably be for a future project).  25   OP A. G.

First, note  how Luhmann simply jotted down keyterms like   randomness . Second,  he also wrote down terms in the following way {keyterm} as {supporting  context}. In essence, Luhmann stated the keyterm first, and then inserted  the phrase   as . After   as   Luhmann would provide a snippet of detail that would  contextualize the keyterm. For instance, we see the phrase   reality as function  of expectedness . This method of creating bibnotes stands as both a way of  thinking and a practice one should experiment with. It results in building  knowledge around the keyterm (not around the supporting context, which  sits in a subordinate position to the main idea of the keyterm).  The Bib Box  Luhmann’s bibliography box (aka, the   bib box ) was a critical component of  his Antinet. The cards in this section show Luhmann’s thoughts before they  were processed fully into main notes. Luhmann’s second Antinet contained  67,000 cards, with 15,000 (roughly 22%) of them bibcards.  Given how large a portion of Luhmann’s second Antinet was devoted to  bibcards, you would think these would be outlined in Sönke Ahrens’s book  How to Take Smart Notes . Yet this component of Luhmann’s system is almost  completely omitted in Ahrens’s tutorial. His instructions for how to create  this critical component of the Antinet is basically: “I strongly recommend  using a free program like Zotero.” 28  The bib box stores your bibcards in alphabetical order. It’s where you place  your bibcards after you finish the book.  28   Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing,  Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers (North  Charleston, SC: CreateSpace, 2017), 30
434      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  ONE READS DIFFERENTLY WITH AN  ANTINET  Written on a card in Luhmann’s own Antinet we find a card on how one  “reads differently” when using an Antinet. 29   Johannes Schmidt notes that  Luhmann read “with an eye to the notes already contained in his file.” 30  This phenomenon is something other scholars have confirmed: “it is indis -  putable that in books [he read], Luhmann searched for information or ideas  that could be linked to the content of his own card index.” 31  With enough practice with an Antinet, there is a phase transition that occurs  whereby you begin to read in such a way that you no longer get “bogged  down” by writing out full-excerpts. 32  If we look at Luhmann’s second Antinet and its 15,000 bibcards, most of  which referenced books, we can make some calculations (without accounting  for titles which span multiple bibcards, which indeed occurred, but not too  frequently). Luhmann worked with his second Antinet from roughly 1963 to  1997, which comes out to thirty four years. We can make some calculations  (without accounting for titles which span multiple bibcards, which indeed  occurred, but wasn’t too frequent). If we divide 15,000 bibcards by thirty  four years, this gives us 441 titles per year; 37 titles per month; or roughly  one title per day.  In other words, on average Luhmann read roughly one book or journal  article per day… for thirty four years.  29   “ZK II: Sheet 9/8d—Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed March 4, 2022,   https://  niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8d_V .  30   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

435 E XTRACTION     There’s no way to do this by reading the way normal people read (slowly,  sounding out every word in their head). The nature in which Luhmann  read was   selective . I call it   selective reading . You ingest books at a phenomenal  rate, like a reading machine, thanks to the   priming   step we covered in the  previous chapter. I suggest this is a hybrid between skimming and reading  every sentence. Instead of reading every word, you read every paragraph of  the book. You don’t try to comprehend each individual word, or each sen -  tence even. Your goal is to comprehend the paragraph quickly, and move on.  When you spot an intriguing idea you slow down. At that point your brain  undertakes a communication experience in order to draw up concepts from  your Antinet. You then run the new material through a filter:   is this idea bad,  good, excellent, or irresistible?   If it’s irresistible, you extract it onto your bibcard.  As Mortimer Adler advises, reading should not be thought of as a passive  activity. 33   It’s an   active   process. When employing the bibcard extraction  method it’s an even faster, more alert process.  SLOWLY CHEWING ON BOOKS  There will be books that are worth chewing on (reading them slowly and  deliberately). Typically, these will be the books you read when you’re in  exploratory   mode; when you have yet to develop a rough skeleton to serve  as the foundation of your project. In this mode, you ought to employ the  book-to-maincard method. You also must shift your mindset. You must  slow down your thinking and not worry about processing books efficiently.  In this mode you ought to adopt the advice of people like David Deutsch,  a great copywriter. Deutsch famously emphasized that it was better to read  one great book ten times, instead of ten good books one time. 34   In this mode  you should opt to be well-read, not widely read. As Mortimer Adler puts it:  33   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev. and updated ed  (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 4.  34   Ben Settle, “The 10-Minute Workday,” https://www.awai.com/members/10-minute/, Unit  12, 4.
436      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  There have always been literate ignoramuses who have read  too widely and not well. The Greeks had a name for such a  mixture of learning and folly which might be applied to the  bookish but poorly read of all ages. They are all sophomores. 35  SYNTOPICAL READING  If you already have a base-level structure for what you’re working on, then it’s  safer to adopt swifter extraction methods. There are certain books that are so  dense, widely-cited, and profound that you just   know   they deserve a slower  read. And there are certain books that are suited for swift   selective reading .  One of the more enjoyable ways to partake in selective reading is to employ a  process called   syntopical reading . 36   With syntopical reading, you read several  books on the same subject, at the same time. This is something Luhmann  did, as well. In a short piece Luhmann wrote on reading, he states: “Another  possibility is to read texts [across] certain topics.” 37  In order to read syntopically, Luhmann writes, “You have to be able to read  highly   selectively   and pull out widely interconnected references.” 38   Basically  you must train your mind to spot certain patterns. This is something neuro -  imprinting keyterms on your mind helps with (by way of the index).  Here, Luhmann’s referring to storing ideas in long-term memory in the  Antinet, such that they evolve and you do not waste your time relearning  what you already know.  According to Luhmann, the key to reading scientific texts revolves around  this act. You must read selectively, and not waste time relearning what you  already know. The key piece in this process relates to   long-term memory   and  35   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev. and updated ed  (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 11.  36   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev. and updated ed  (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 301.  37   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 82.  38   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 83.
437 E XTRACTION     the necessity to distinguish the “essential from the non-essential and the  new from the merely repetitive.” 39   In other words, you want a system where  you can refresh your recollection of your notes and evolve your current  ideas with new ideas; you don’t want to waste time relearning things you  already know.  I like to do this in the following manner: I carve out two hours of back-to-  back reading. For the first hour I read one book within one topic. In the next  hour I read a different book within that same topic. For example, several  years ago I read two books predicting what the future would look like and  the technologies that would shape it. The first book I read was   The Industries  of the Future;   the book I read was   The Inevitable . By reading syntopically,  I spotted interesting patterns—things that they both agreed upon and the  contradictions between them. In addition, I noticed that each of them  omitted something which served as an important piece of the other’s book.  Again, reading this way usually comes   after   the exploratory phase. It comes  after you’ve gained a sense for what you actually wish to create. However,  when you’re ready for this type of reading style, the bibcard extraction  method, as well as the Antinet as a whole, takes the experience to a whole  new level.  In brief, you’ll read differently with an Antinet because you’ve been training  and exercising your   neuro-associative recall   muscle. You see, even before  reading the first page of a book, you’ll have primed your mind to detect  certain keyterms and ideas by way of creating index entries of keyterms. The  Antinet, with its neuroimprinting process of writing by hand, develops your  neuro-associative recall ability. When reading, you’ll find yourself thinking  of keyterms in your index. This is hugely beneficial because it saves you time.  You can simply jot keyterms down on a bibcard, instead of having to write  out lengthier notes.  39   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 83.
438      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  CONCLUSION  Now you have an idea for the process of extracting material from the sources  you engage with. We outlined several strategies (the best one being the  2-step bibcard method). We now turn to the next critical phase of knowledge  development:   Creation .
439  C H A PT E R F I F T E E N  �  CREATION  T he creation phase of knowledge   development is where the magic  really starts to happen. In this phase you begin adding your own   meaning  to the information you extract from the sources you choose to communicate  with. In this phase, you begin injecting your own   personality   into the infor -  mation. As a result, you create knowledge with your own unique perspective  with the potential of making an impact on the world.  We’re going to survey a large swath of material in this section. The best place  to start is exploring the nature of notes.  THE NATURE OF THE NOTES  What are notes? I think there are several ways to answer this question. One  helpful way to understand the nature of notes is to use some metaphors.  In this section I’ll present three illustrations: (1) notes as thoughts, (2) notes  as leaves, and (3) notes as neurons.  NOTES AS THOUGHTS  At this point it’s helpful to refresh our memory of what a   thought   actually is.  A thought is a metaphysical representation of reality. This reality can be  external reality (such as things you see), or internal reality (such as your  internal experience, intuition or feelings). The reality can be true in nature  or true in fiction (as Hemingway emphasized, each novelist should write  the truth). A thought is also shaped by several dimensions, which are rep -  resented in the following diagram:
440      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  A thought is shaped by one’s   self . You have your own concept of a self (ego,  persona or identity). You think of yourself in a certain way that shapes your  thoughts. Your experiences, stories, trials, tribulations, and past serve as a  background context for your self. Your   self   shapes your thoughts. Your self  also embodies the unique ways your brain works based on its biochemical  arrangement. Based on your DNA, based on   how you’re wired .  A thought is also shaped by   space:   where you are in space, your latitude,  longitude, and altitude. You’ve heard the phrase,   you are your environment .  It’s really: your thoughts are your environment—or at least, your thoughts  are shaped by your environment. Your thoughts would be different if you  lived in Bangladesh (assuming you’re not already living in Bangladesh).  In brief, where you reside right now in space shapes your thoughts.  A thought is also shaped by   time . How you think of something today is  drastically different from how you’d have thought of it ten years prior. It’s  also drastically different from how you’ll think of the same thing ten years  from now. We’re always changing, and our thoughts change with us. Yet it’s  not only our   selves   changing that shapes thoughts. It’s also the world around  us. The thoughts you have today would be drastically different if you were  suddenly transported two thousand years into the past or future—even if  you were to remain the same age, in the same physical body, and at the same  physical location. Your own place in time, as well as your own world’s place  in time, has a significant impact on which thoughts you experience.
441 C REATION     A thought is also shaped by   memory   (or   reverberation ). This is closely related  to the concept of   self , but it’s more specific. It’s related to our short-term  concept of self. We have a memory that fades over time. Our recent actions  and things we’ve read—say in the past month—are still reverberating  through our minds. Our recent behavior, our recent purchases, the books,  TV shows and movies we’ve seen recently shape our thoughts. After some  point, however, these memories fade. Every single day we enter a new state  wherein some thoughts will arise, and other thoughts simply will not. This is  shaped by our memory which is almost like a rolling wave of reverberation.  A thought is also shaped by   content . The current content that has our atten -  tion and what we’re consuming shapes our thoughts. The TV show you’re  watching or book you’re reading shapes thoughts. While you’re ingesting the  sources of content, you’re relating the concepts to what you already know.  You’re trying to comprehend the concepts and either accepting or rejecting  them. When you’re consuming content, you’re   selecting   which information  resonates with you. After reading this book, you’re hopefully learning to  select   only irresistible material. As you continue with your Antinet, whenever  you engage with content, you’re writing down your observational thoughts  (onto bibcards).  All of these dimensions (self, space, time, memory, content) shape the  phenomena that is a thought. The thoughts can be voluntary or involuntary.  Regardless, the metaphysical phenomenon that is a thought is then the raw  unit captured and immortalized by way of being written down on paper in  the form of a notecard. A note, then, is essentially a container of thought.  Or, more succinctly, a   thought   container .  Thought Containers  I think it’s helpful to think of notes as a mechanism, or a container of thought.  The scholar, Markus Krajewski, likens notes to “Denk-zettel,” which is a  German term translating roughly to “thought-notes.” 1   These are the “units”  that stand as the raw material of the Antinet.  1   Markus Krajewski,   Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice of a Counter-Measurement  against Forgetting   (Brill, 2016), 319.
442      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  There are four components of notes as thought containers. First, notes are  containers that develop one’s short-term thoughts. They are a mechanism for  thought that enables one to reflect and actually instantiate the phenomenon  going on internally in one’s mind.  Second, notes are containers for developing one’s long-term thoughts.  If structured properly, notes can serve as a container to collect and evolve  thoughts over the long term. This is thanks to the nested tree structure of  the Antinet.  Third, notes serve as prompts to help the mind   recollect   knowledge. 2   In dig -  ital Zettelkasten systems, many people have a tendency to view notes as an  all-encompassing document. In digital systems, users regularly tend to their  notes, constantly updating and deleting text. Yet truly powerful note systems  are not like this. They simply serve as a cue or a prompt to trigger neurons  in your brain to fire and connect. As a result you end up grasping an idea  that is often incommunicable. You then use your manuscript or project to  make the incommunicable knowledge lucid and clear. The notes within the  Antinet are a means to the end (the end being your creative output). This is  something that will continually arise throughout this section.  Fourth, notes are a container encompassing different types of thoughts.  As one scholar puts it, notes are “free-floating   staging posts of thought , which  record all manner of remarkable things, excerpts and quotes in the perma -  nence of script.” 3   Notes serve as a container for   observing   what the material  you’re reading relates to. Notes serve as a container for thoughts which encap -  sulate what an author is saying ( excerpt   notes), as a container for learning  material by summarizing concepts in your own words ( reformulation   notes),  and as a container for   reflecting   on what material means to you, particularly  within the context of a current project you’re working on.  2   Richard Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices   (Brill, 2016), 154.  3   Markus Krajewski,   Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice of a Counter-Measurement  against Forgetting   (Brill, 2016), 319. Emphasis added.
443 C REATION     Notes as Memories  Given that a note can be thought of as a thought (pun intended), it can also  be thought of as a   memory . Why? Because a memory is a stored represen -  tation of a thought.  Think of a note as a thought, an abstraction, and as a memory. The prob -  lem with digital notes is that they are unidimensional rather than multidi -  mensional. They are virtual; they live in a man-made dimension. Physical  thoughts present in space and time have more dimensionality than purely  metaphysical systems. This is something digital will have to overcome if it  wishes to have the potency of analog knowledge systems.  A thought gets stored and represented as a   memory . It’s therefore important  to note—again, pun intended—that how human memory works   is not  unidimensional. Rather, human memory is like a matrix. A memory is a  combination of multiple   attributes   and   contexts . A well-developed hypoth -  esis posits that individual memories are distributed over multiple attributes,  features, elements, or dimensions. 4  Let’s translate this into something practical: the notecard that I’ve written  on the topic of   love   is easy to spot. Why? Because I decided to write it on  an actual leaf!  4   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory. (New York: Oxford University  Press, 2014), 85.
444      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The words on the leaf are the lyrics of   All You Need Is Love   by the   Beatles .  This is an example of the multi-dimensionality of notes.  You see, early on into a relationship with my now fiancé, I asked her to pick  out a leaf for me when she was with our daughter on a hike. This card is  packed not only with intriguing features, but with an entire background  story as well. The character of this note is also represented by the style of  my handwriting, as well as its content.  Human memories function much like this. They are multidimensional objects  and not merely digital texts or even digital pictures or diagrams.  The Antinet as a Perfect System of Thought  The Antinet is constructed in a way that emphasizes the two laws that govern  thought. The concept that thought is governed by two laws derives from  British philosophers John Locke, David Hume, George Berkeley, David  Hartley and John Stuart Mill who suggested that thoughts are governed by  two components.   5  1.   Contiguity: the notion that ideas that are frequently experienced together  become closely associated in one’s mind. In the Antinet, the sequence  of notes results in closely associated streams of thoughts. These streams  of thought are thereby organized closely together in a sequence. This is  made possible by the numeric-alpha card addresses and tree structure.  2.   Similarity (resemblance): when two ideas are similar, whatever has been  closely associated with the first idea (thereby starting the flow of thought)  automatically also becomes associated with the following thoughts. The  following thoughts are those that then branch downward from the  initial thought.  5   Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works, Norton pbk (New York: Norton, 2009), 113.
445 C REATION     NOTES AS LEAVES  Another helpful metaphor is to think of notes as   leaves . The tree metaphor  for the Antinet serves as a perfect illustration due to its branching nature.  A core component of this metaphor is the leaves on a tree.  The leaves on a tree are (relatively) uniform, yet there’s variation between  leaves, as well. Some leaves are withered, some have holes in them, and some  grow old and dry up. This also happens with notes in the Antinet. Some  have holes of logic in them, and some grow old because they’re unlinked.  In addition to this, a note-as-a-leaf cannot be simply encapsulated by a short,  condensed title. You must view the entire leaf to understand it. When view -  ing a notecard, you must view the note in its entirety to understand it. On  the other hand, with digital notetaking apps, one is forced to squeeze the  material of each note into a brief title. This dilutes the material found in the  note. For instance, a note that contains profound ideas on the concept of  a   thought   is titled   Definition of a Thought . However, this is not the nature of  particular leaves. There’s no title for each leaf. To understand the nature of  any given leaf you must view the entirety of the leaf. This is the same for notes.  The practical lesson is this: Do not weaken your notes by assigning a  human-readable title to them. Respect your thoughts by having the thought  contain itself (instead of being contained in a catchy title).  NOTES AS NEURONS  Another way to think of notes is to liken them to neurons in the human brain.  As I detail in a later section on human memory, the neural networks we  think of today as   legitimate   are, in reality, merely artificial abstractions, with  the result being that the models researchers use to study human memory  “bear only a faint resemblance to real biological neurons: they are highly  simplified computational ‘units’ that integrate and transmit information.” 6  This description seems to perfectly encapsulate what a note is. Most of what  6   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory. (New York: Oxford  University Press, 2014), 152.
446      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  people think of when they hear the term   neural network   isn’t actually a real  thing—it’s artificial. It’s an abstraction. Yet this abstraction nonetheless  made it a very useful system in the real world. The same holds true for  the Antinet.  Neurons are the perfect stand-in for the concept of notes. Notes fit the defi -  nition of “ highly simplified computational ‘units’ that integrate and transmit  information ,” which is one reason why the Antinet works so well—or at least  better than information stored in silos of commonplace books.  Niklas Luhmann was familiar with how human memory worked and also  deliberate in his design of the Antinet. It’s no coincidence that he built his  system based on the idea of connections (inspired by connections of neu -  rons in the human brain).  Luhmann pointed out how human memory does not   function as a sum of  point-by-point access locations   (such as sequentially moving through notes). 7  Rather your brain utilizes internal links and connections. It’s helpful when  thinking about a note to view it as a raw unit, as a neuron. The neuron gains  its value when it is connected to other notes by way of installing the note  under or behind its most similar idea. The neuron is further enriched by  connecting to other neurons in your tree of knowledge. This is done by  creating remotelinks to other cards on more distant branches of your Antinet.  The latest research in human memory also supports this, revealing evidence  for something termed the   distributed representation   of memory. 8   This idea  holds that a memory is represented by not merely one notecard (or one  neuron), but by an interaction between a large set of neurons.  7   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

447 C REATION     THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT  DEFINITIONS OF NOTES WITHIN  ZETTELKASTEN LITERATURE  THE PROBLEM WITH THE TERM ZETTEL  The German term   Zettel   translates into “note” in American English. How -  ever, in European English it has been translated into “slip,” and denotes a  slip of paper of   a 6-size as defined by ISO standards (roughly the size of  4 x 6 inch notecards). Regardless of the slight difference in terms ( note   vs.  slip ), it’s become conventional for so-called followers of Zettelkasten to  throw around the term   Zettel . For instance, they ask for critiques on the  Zettels   they’ve created.  There’s one issue, however. Many Zettelkasten enthusiasts use the term  Zettel as the equivalent of a   reflection note . They think of Zettels as some  type of evergreen, atomic, permanent note. However, roughly seventeen  thousand out of Luhmann’s ninety thousand notes were not so-called  “Zettels” as these enthusiasts would define it. They were observation notes  written down on Luhmann’s bibcards. Of the remaining notes, there were  many that were just hub notes containing links to other cards (Collectives),  or external references (ExRefs). For this reason, I’ve decided to ditch the  whole convention of calling notes Zettels because the term implies that  Luhmann had one main type of note. In reality, his so-called “permanent  notes” contained several different types of notes. Using the inaccurate and  vague term Zettel isn’t helpful. It doesn’t make sense to obfuscate this system  even more than it already has been. For this reason, I hereby sentence the  term   Zettel   to death!  Unfortunately Zettel isn’t the only term that’s unhelpful in the currently  confused land of Zettelkasten. Let’s go through the other unhelpful  terms now.  THE PROBLEM WITH FLEETING NOTES  Fleeting notes   is a term coined by Sönke Ahrens in his book,   How to Take  Smart Notes . Ahrens calls fleeting notes those notes that “are only reminders
448      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  of information [that] can be written in any kind of way and will end up in  the trash within a day or two.” 9  The problem with such a concept is that we have zero evidence of Luhmann  actually using such a technique. Why? Because they would end up in the  trash within a day or two. Quite frankly, I’m not sure why Ahrens includes  the concept. My best guess is that this practice is something Ahrens himself  uses and decided to prescribe for his readers.  I personally don’t have a need to use fleeting notes. I take notes on my bib -  cards and then spend my energy processing them by creating main notes.  I’m very disciplined and strict about this process. My bib notes and main  notes are all I need. If I have a thought that continually arises, I’ll wait until  I get to my office with my Antinet. If the thought is truly important I’ll  explore my Antinet and review the stems that the new thought relates to.  If the thought is truly important, I’ll develop it into a main note.  I think the concept of fleeting notes stems from a place of fear—the fear  of a good idea escaping you, never to return. However, I’ve found that the  analog nature of the Antinet has trained my mind and memory to be more  disciplined and less sporadic. According to some, we have over six thousand  thoughts per day. 10   You have to trust the truly important ones will recur  again and again. When they do, don’t waste time creating fleeting notes;  just create a main note for it, if it’s truly relevant.  Luhmann himself was pressed for time and I wouldn’t be surprised to  learn that he never took fleeting notes, either. He was very disciplined and  deliberate in his thinking, and it’s probable that his bib notes acted as his  fleeting notes—as a place to jot down ideas as they first occurred to him  9   Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing,  Learning and Thinking (2nd Edition), Kindle, 2022, 53.  10   Julie Tseng and Jordan Poppenk, “Brain Meta-State Transitions Demarcate Thoughts  across Task Contexts Exposing the Mental Noise of Trait Neuroticism,” Nature  Communications 11, no. 1 (July 13, 2020): 3480.
449 C REATION     while he was reading. Therefore, it makes the whole concept of fleeting notes  redundant and unhelpful.  With that said, I do not discount the idea of fleeting notes being valuable  for some people. I will grant that the idea of writing down thoughts as they  come up is a potentially useful practice. Indeed, writing fleeting thoughts  down has been a practice used by some of our greatest thinkers. Nietzsche  observed that some of the best ideas are born out in the open (on hikes in  nature). Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz always carried paper with him, as well. 11  However, I don’t think fleeting notes are something that need to be elabo -  rated on too much in the context of knowledge development. It’s an obvious  practice if you want to function as an adult. It’s kind of like keeping track of  reminders and appointments. In the rare case I need to capture a fleeting  note, I use a weekly paper planner placed in my fanny pack (yes, I rock a  fanny pack). I’ve found a pen and paper planner to be more useful and less  distracting than using a to-do app, note app, or calendar app on my phone.  There are rare occasions where I’ll want to remind myself of a fleeting thought,  and in that case I’ll write it down in my weekly planner. However, I’ve noticed  a pattern whenever I do this. When it comes time to create a main note for  the thought, I usually find that the idea isn’t really even valuable or useful.  Again, the whole concept of fleeting notes isn’t that important in the work -  flow of using an Antinet. The important pieces are the bib notes and main  notes. For all of these reasons, I opt to drop the whole concept of fleeting  notes altogether.  THE PROBLEM WITH PROJECT NOTES  Another term Sönke Ahrens introduced is that of   project notes . Ahrens  explains these are notes which are “kept within a project-specific folder  and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished.” 12   This whole  11   Markus Krajewski,   Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice of a Counter-Measurement  against Forgetting   (Brill, 2016), 313.  12   Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing,  Learning and Thinking (2nd Edition), Kindle, 2022, 53.
450      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  concept is another Ahrensian invention. One of the most powerful aspects  of the Antinet is that the projects you work on will   compound . Why? Because  they’re installed in the Antinet. This enables the project you work on for  one paper to be potentially used later on in a completely different project.  As Johannes Schmidt writes of Luhmann’s Antinet, “The bulk of the col -  lections (approximately 75,000 cards) consists of notes documenting the  results of Luhmann’s readings, his own thoughts, and ideas for   publication  projects .” 13   In brief, Luhmann stored the material he worked on for projects  inside his own Antinet, not in folders. This can be observed in the notes he  created for his paper   Communication with Noteboxes , as well. 14  In brief, do not store notes you create for a project in some folder outside  the Antinet. Store them in your Antinet so that they can be developed and  used for another project in the long term. You’ll be surprised how much you  end up using from previous material. You may end up stumbling upon the  material by accident at the perfect time when you’ll need it most.  THE PROBLEM WITH LITERATURE NOTES  Literature note   is another term introduced by Ahrens. He writes, “Whenever  you read something, make notes about the content.” 15   These notes are what  he calls   literature notes .  Yet there’s a problem with the term literature notes. First off, it’s vague. What  are literature notes? They’re brief   observations   of what you have read. They  also are placed on a bibcard. For this reason, I prefer the term bib notes  (or observation notes). Second, as mentioned elsewhere, the term literature  notes implies one takes these notes from the literature one reads. However,  this is not the case. These types of notes can and should be drawn from many  sources (podcasts, videos, lectures, and more). In the words of John Aubrey,  13   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution  in Early Modern Europe 53 (2016), 292.

451 C REATION     a fellow of the Royal Society, “material gathered should not be confined to  that offered in books.” 16  For these reasons, I suggest dropping the term   literature notes   and instead  using   bib notes   (short for   bibliography notes ). In cases in which you’re using  a 1-step book-to-maincard method, then it’s more appropriate to refer to  them as   observation notes .  THE PROBLEM WITH PERMANENT NOTES  Permanent note   is yet another Ahrensian term that has become part of the  Zettelkasten canon. Ahrens defines permanent notes as those “which will  never be thrown away and [that] contain the necessary information in a  permanently understandable way.” 17  There are several problems with this term.  First off, the term   permanent   is redundant. Every note you install in the  Antinet is permanent. The cards you place in the main box of your Antinet  are permanent, and so are the cards you install in the bibliography and index  box. Calling a note permanent doesn’t differentiate it from the many different  types of permanent notes that Luhmann, for example, created.  What’s even more perplexing is that the idea of permanent notes seems  primarily geared toward digital Zettelkasten practitioners. The idea behind  permanent notes is that they permanently define a concept and are then  referenced (without being deleted or updated). However, this is problematic  for digital notetaking apps. Why? Because digital notes are anything but  permanent! Their contents are constantly being refactored, updated, deleted  and rearranged. For this reason a new term was invented called   evergreen  notes. According to the inventor of the term, evergreen notes are “written  and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across proj -  16   Richard Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices   (Brill, 2016), 138.  17   Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing,  Learning and Thinking (2nd Edition), Kindle, 2022, 53.
452      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  ects.” 18   The coiner of this term differentiates it from another coined term:  transient notes . The idea of these notes centers around the idea of notes just  being stored in containers and never evolving.  All of this stuff is just confusing gibberish. It’s a case of people trying to invent  terms to encompass what Luhmann’s Antinet really was. Luhmann’s notes  were indeed permanent. They were not edited. Using such a system, one’s  thinking is thereby stamped in history. Yet the notes also evolved thanks to  the tree structure of the Antinet. This concept isn’t really captured in the  terms permanent notes or evergreen notes.  For these reason I drop the term permanent notes altogether (same goes for  evergreen notes). A better way of thinking about notes is in the terminology  I’ll be introducing soon. But before I introduce the four types of notes, let’s  first talk about the art of note creation.  THE ART OF NOTE CREATION  The following section may create endless suffering for computer scientists,  engineers, and especially digital notetaking junkies (the ones with one-  hundred-point checklists and templates for creating notes). Here’s the truth:  the Antinet may not be the right tool for those focused on optimization and  strict adherence to protocol.  NOTES ARE A MEANS TO AN END  The Antinet—and any knowledge development system for that matter—  is not   the end . It’s not the output. It’s not the destination. Knowledge devel -  opment should not be beautiful; it should be messy, drenched in sweat, ink,  coffee stains and some loops that are never closed. Knowledge development  contains notes which are raw products. The materials serve as products of  your thinking. This raw product doesn’t happen before or after you think,  it happens   as you think . The symbols on physical paper represent the truest  and closest representation of your thinking.  18   “Evergreen Notes,” Andy’s working notes, accessed April 21, 2022, https://notes.andy -  matuschak.org/Evergreennotes.
453 C REATION     The goal is for your creative output, not your notes, to be beautiful  and profound.  In brief,   notes are a means to an end, not the end itself . The goal is for the   output  phase   to be deeply developed and ordered. It’s OK for the   process phase   to  be seemingly chaotic.  NOT EVERY NOTE WILL BE USED  Another thing to keep in mind is that you should not put pressure on yourself  to only produce notes that end up getting used.  When writing notes, according to Luhmann, “the first thing one does is  produce a lot of waste.” 19   If you don’t anticipate this, you may find yourself  discouraged; this is why many people burn out on personal knowledge man -  agement systems, and digital Zettelkasten with which it’s all-too-easy to create  mountains of information. You hit a certain point where you’ve created so  19   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 83.
454      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  much information such that seemingly none of it will ever be used. This can  lead to despair and to people giving up knowledge development altogether. 20  As Luhmann acknowledges, “We are educated to expect something useful  from our activities and otherwise quickly lose encouragement.” 21   However,  with the Antinet, I’ve found that since it takes longer to produce material,  you’re incentivized to produce less waste. In addition, you produce less  overall. This results in   more   of the material and notes you create being used  (in comparison to digital workflows that distract you with the labeling,  organizing, and reworking of notes).  The good news about the Antinet, and one of its invaluable features, is that  it forces users to “prepare their notes in such a way that they are available  for later access.” 22   If not easily findable, every note you take is a candidate  for an unexpected and invaluable insight if you happen to stumble upon it.  Even if you don’t stumble upon a particular card, it creates what Luhmann  deems, “a consoling illusion” that mitigates against the risk of discouragement  during the knowledge development process. 23  In brief, think of knowledge development with the Antinet like exercising  the mind. Exercise is good for you. Creating notes and installing them into  the Antinet is good for you. It’s a process. It’s a workout for your mind. You’ll  start seeing results in the short term, yes. However, it’s something you ought  to strive to keep up as a long-term practice.  PRESS ON  When using an Antinet for knowledge development, you must remind  yourself to do one thing:   press on . Prepare yourself to take notes by hand.  You must train yourself to slow down and pause to think. Reformulating the  author’s words with your own voice is very hard work.  20   “Rank and File,” Real Life, accessed January 14, 2022, https://reallifemag.com/rank-and-file/.  21   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 83.  22   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 83.  23   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 83.
455 C REATION     Luhmann’s advice on how to read scientific literature echoes this advice.  He says it’s best to take reformulation notes—and continue to do so—even  if it means you must “postpone the hope of scientific productivity for a  while.” 24   For challenging texts, this is how you level up in your reading. It’s  how you level up your intellect. Slowing down is how you get to the point  where you can take reflection notes on advanced texts.  THE PROCESS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE  RESULT  As Richard Feynman explained, his notes were not a record of his thinking;  they   were   his thinking. “They are my thinking process,” Feynman says. 25  The goal of creating notes is   not   to provide you with a written record of infor -  mation. Rather, it’s to develop your mind—it’s to develop your thoughts. 26  This is one reason why I don’t lose sleep at night. I don’t fear the prospect of  my Antinet catching on fire. The transformation within one’s brain (using  an Antinet) is more valuable than undeveloped information stored on a  computer (which doesn’t face the same risk of destruction in terms of fire  or flood).  As one cognitive scientist puts it, “research reveals the main value of note-  taking is through its effect on how you encode the information in your brain.”  In other words, she continues, “the   act   of note-taking is more important  than the result.” 27   I agree.  THE TWO CLASSES OF NOTES  There are two types of note creation: Notetaking and   notemaking . 28  24   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 83.  25   “How Writing Improves Our Thinking,” Residential Systems, June 15, 2020, https://www.  residentialsystems.com/blogs/how-writing-improves-our-thinking.  26   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 6.  27   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 6.  28   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 5.
456      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Notetaking  Notetaking refers to the process of recording your own   observations   that you  have while engaging with a source such as a book. For instance, let’s talk  about what occurs when you use the 2-step Luhmannian bibcard method.  When you record individual bibnotes on a bibcard, the nature of the notes  are   observations . You’re recording the thoughts you have while reading the  text. In essence, you’re taking notes directly influenced by the source.  Notemaking  With notemaking, you’re a step beyond notetaking and are actually creating  a standalone note from the observations you’ve made while reading. You  make   a main note from the observations you’ve recorded on your bibcard.  The main notes are either   excerpts ,   reformulations , or   reflections   of the mate -  rial. The difference between   notetaking   and   notemaking   is a little fuzzy—  especially with regards to   excerpt notes   (as they’re a direct copy of the source  material). Yet, because excerpt notes are installed and applied to a specific  area or line of thought within the branches or stems of your Antinet, it’s  defensible that they be classified as part of the   notemaking   process. When  you cut the umbilical cord of the material that directly connects to a book,  and instead connect the material to a chain of concepts in your Antinet,  you’re partaking in notemaking.  Notetaking vs. Notemaking  In summary, notetaking is a process enacted through creating bibcards  which contain observations during your readings. Notemaking is a process  enacted through main notes which contain excerpt notes, reformulation  notes, and reflection notes. The differences will start to make sense where  it truly matters: in practice. Let’s now talk about the four main types of  notes in practice.  YOUR NOTE-CREATION REPERTOIRE  You must have multiple note-creation strategies in your repertoire when  creating knowledge. There’s “no one ‘best’ strategy for taking notes,” states  one cognitive scientist. 29  29   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press,
457 C REATION     The strategy you choose for creating knowledge depends on several factors. 30  What type of note you decide to create depends on your   working memory  capacity . As you use the Antinet over time, your working memory capacity  will improve. Yet sometimes you don’t have enough bandwidth to simply  reflect   on notes. Sometimes you need to first create a full   excerpt   note in order  to construct several cards to express your thoughts. This is one factor that has  an impact on which type of note you create during knowledge development.  Another factor that affects note creation is   external distraction . We already  know how distracting the digital environment can be. Research shows us  how often people are distracted and pulled into checking communication  apps. For 50% of people, it’s every six minutes! 31   Yet even following an analog  workflow, your environment may provide distractions. If you’re crammed  onto a plane, it’s a lot easier to use the 2-step Luhmannian bibcard method,  for instance, than it would be trying to manage fifteen different notecards  on your tray table.  Not only do external distractions affect your workflow, but   internal distrac -  tions   do so as well. When you practice the 1-step book-to-maincard method,  it requires a lot of focus. You must be in a very present state of mind to have  the self-awareness to know when you’re getting unnecessarily bogged down  in material. If your internal life is in a state of distress and you’re facing many  internal distractions, your note creation method should accommodate  that state.  The last factor that affects how you should create notes is the   difficulty   of the  material. If you’re tackling a challenging text, understanding the material is  a prerequisite for reflecting on the material. How well you understand what  you’re reading shapes how you should go about creating notes. In many cases  you must first either excerpt or reformulate the material.  2018), 10.  30   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 10.  31   Cal Newport, A World Without Email: Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication  Overload (New York: Portfolio, 2021), 11.
458      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  It’s important to know about these factors when deciding   what   type of note  to create, and   how   to create them. However don’t worry yourself about  trying to hold the types in mind during the note creation process. The  understanding of these factors, and what process works best for you will  come with time and practice.  Let’s now get into the four types of notes.  THE FOUR TYPES OF NOTES  There are four types of notes:  1.   Observation notes  2.   Excerpt notes  3.   Reformulation notes  4.   Reflection notes  Observation notes are traditionally recorded on bibcards (vertical 4 x 6 inch  notecards used while reading or engaging with a source), whereas the other  three notes (excerpt, reformulation, and reflection notes) are created on  maincards (which are horizontal 4 x 6 inch notecards).
459 C REATION     Let’s go through each of these in detail now.  OBSERVATION NOTES  John Aubrey, a fellow of the Royal Society, once likened the taking of notes to  being a traveller. You don’t want to merely copy down a diagram of the map,  he said. Rather, you want to explore the land or territory and record your  own   observations . 32   In other words, you want to record your own thoughts.  These types of notes are observation notes. John Locke took these types  of notes, as well. One scholar referred to Locke’s notes as “observations  and thoughts.” 33   Another scholar refers to observation notes as “one’s own  comments or annotations on individual textual passages.” 34  Where Observation Notes Live  I teach Antinetters to employ the 2-step Luhmannian bibcard method, with  the notes written down on the bibcard being observation notes. While I hold  that bibcards are the best medium for capturing observation notes, they’re  not the only place observation notes can live. As previously mentioned, some  users jot down observation notes in book margins. Some may even extract  observation notes onto individual (non-bibcard) notecards while reading  a text. In fact, I’ve done such on 3 x 5 inch notecards before.  Observation Notes vs. Reflection Notes  The main characteristic that differentiates an observation note from a reflec -  tion note is that observation notes are very short. They’re brief pieces of  text that represent the brief thought you have immediately in the moment  of reading a text.  EXCERPT NOTES  Excerpt notes are notes in that you copy down word-for-word from a text  as a direct quote. Here’s an example:  32   Richard Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices   (Brill, 2016), 138-9.  33   Richard Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices   (Brill, 2016), 149.  34   Markus Krajewski,   Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice of a Counter-Measurement  against Forgetting   (Brill, 2016), 322.
460      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  According to one scholar, excerpts do the following things: (1) they capture  a text’s “train of thought”; (2) they capture the structure of a text’s argument;  and (3) they contain the worthwhile details of a text and its references to  secondary literature. 35   These serve as a few reasons why one should opt to  excerpt texts.  However, I think there are other reasons to employ excerpt notes. First, some -  times the prose of a text is so commanding that it’s worthwhile to excerpt the  entire quote. It’s worth excerpting in order to use the quote in your creative  output. It’s also worth excerpting in order to neuroimprint the prose onto  your mind so that you can refine and develop your own writing skills.  “Sometimes a mere recital of facts can itself lead to a greater understanding,”  Mortimer Adler writes. 36   In other words, the practice of writing down an  important snippet of text that you don’t quite understand can actually lead  to more understanding. Elsewhere in this book I mentioned that in the late  35   Markus Krajewski,   Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice of a Counter-Measurement  against Forgetting   (Brill, 2016), 322.  36   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev. and updated ed  (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 10.
461 C REATION     seventeenth century at Harvard College, students were taught from textbooks  bought in England. How were they taught specifically? By having students  write down the material contained in the texts by hand. 37   Harvard imple -  mented this practice because it worked. It may not be the most engaging  way to teach; however the solitude and time spent rehearsing the words in  one’s mind, by excerpting them down on paper, ends up leading to greater  understanding of the material.  I advise the use of excerpt notes when you’re trying to really stretch your  mind. When you’re tackling a challenging text and you encounter a criti -  cal part, it may be wise to excerpt the section or concepts. When engag -  ing with a challenging text, it’s also recommended to employ the 1-step  book-to-maincard method.  If you’re engaging with a not-so-challenging text, there are still several  instances in which you ought to excerpt material. For instance, if you wish  to use the excerpt to support your argument, it’s often useful to quote the  author directly. It’s also advisable to use a direct quote when your goal is to  refute   an argument.  REFORMULATION NOTES  Luhmann was adamant in his views that one should not get bogged down  with excerpt notes. Yet he seemed to follow the   do as I say ,   not as I do  principle in this regard. We know this because he took extensive excerpt  notes. Regardless, Luhmann does instruct us in the taking of a special type  of note called   reformulations . “Perhaps the best method is to take notes—  not excerpts, but condensed   reformulations   of what has been read.” 38  Reformulation notes entail summarizing and creating a form of the idea   in  your own words   so that, as Luhmann put it, you are creating a “re-description  of what has already been described.” 39  37   Ann Blair,   Early Modern Attitudes toward the Delegation of Copying and Note-Taking   (Brill,  2016), 278.  38   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 83. Emphasis added.  39   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 83.
462      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Why Reformulations?  According to Luhmann, reformulation notes automatically train one’s mind  in such a way that it creates a lens or “frame of mind” for spotting pat -  terns. 40   This process operates in the same way the index does. Reformulation  notes enable you to neuroimprint ideas so that you can observe and read  literature differently.  Reformulation notes force you to question why the author uses certain  words. You’re able to pay attention to vocabulary and usage. How? Because  you’re investing the additional time necessary in understanding a text well  enough to re-describe the concept; you’re forced to spot “conditions that  lead to the text offering certain descriptions and not others,” Luhmann says. 41  Reformulating an author’s ideas in your own words forces you to   slow down  and   chew on   the material. This practice forces you to think.  Fiona McPherson, who specializes in the field of notetaking, echoes Luh -  mann’s advice. She asserts, “Note-taking is effective to the extent that  you paraphrase, organize and make sense of information while taking  notes.” 42   Essentially, one of the most effective forms of notetaking is that  of reformulation notes.  Like Luhmann, McPherson goes on to warn against excerpt notes. She  refers to excerpt notes as “verbatim notes,” asserting they’re of “minimum  value” unless they are used as a staging post, or as “stepping stones” to later  paraphrase and then turn into reformulation notes. With this, I partly agree,  however I urge one to not overlook the power of excerpt notes in neuroim -  printing valuable ideas onto your mind.  McPherson holds a very strong opinion on the importance of reformulation  notes, stating that reformulations are “the most important” Notetaking  40   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 83.  41   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 83.  42   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 6.
463 C REATION     skill. 43   While I think this may be an overstatement (each type of note has its  utility), I won’t disagree with her on the potency of reformulations.  Good reformulations extract the meaning of what the author says. The  goal centers on creating reformulations that are short, relevant, and in your  own words. 44  Types of Reformulation Notes  There are several types of reformulation notes. The following collection is by  no means comprehensive, and the lines get fuzzy when you zoom in with a  microscope around their borders; the types of reformulations listed will cer -  tainly give you some idea and a feel for their nature. Let’s go through them now.  TOPICAL REFORMULATIONS  Topical reformulations   are text-based summaries of content. The goal here  is quite simple. Instead of excerpting an entire passage, you want to explain  the idea in your own words. Topical reformulations “summarize the main  points without adding any new information or offering a new perspective.” 45  Here’s an example of a topical reformulation:  43   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 60.  44   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 67.  45   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 66.
464      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  OUTLINE REFORMULATIONS  Outline reformulations   refer to the process of breaking down material into a  series of steps. For instance, if faced with a daunting wall of text, it’s helpful  to break apart the material into steps. Here’s an example of this:  This outline reformulation will look familiar to you. It’s what I used to  assemble the section several pages back on having a note creation repertoire.  There are several scenarios in which outline reformulations prove to be the  best reformulation strategy. Here are such instances:  1.   If the text is simple and based primarily on facts, it’s a good idea to use  outline reformulations.  2.   If you’re limited on time, then it’s a good idea to use outline reformulations  (instead of diagram reformulations, which will be explained shortly).  3.   If the material will not represent a major framework in what you intend  to teach, then it’s a good idea to opt for an outline reformulation (instead  of a diagram reformulation).
465 C REATION     4. If the information is more hierarchical in nature, then it’s a good idea to  employ an outline reformulation. Where outline reformulations really  shine is in conjunction with texts presenting hierarchical material. Indeed,  perhaps “they’re only good for displaying hierarchical information.” 46  DIAGRAM REFORMULATIONS  Diagram reformulations   are doodles, graphics, illustrations or drawings that  represent an idea. You’ve seen such diagram illustrations throughout this  text. The pretty drawn illustrations in this text were made by my lovely fiancé.  However they initially began as notecards drawn by myself.  For instance here’s one of my diagram reformulations:  After my fiancé drew it up, it turned out like this:  46   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 91.
466      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  These are diagram reformulations, and I believe they contain the most  untapped potential for the Antinet. It’s truly remarkable how much under -  standing and knowledge can be communicated through simple diagrams.  It’s a practice I’ve never seen Luhmann himself do, yet it’s something I highly  recommend integrating into your own repertoire.  The earliest human communication through time, using physical represen -  tation, was expressed not in words, but in pictures—using pictographs and  cave paintings. 47  According to some research, diagram reformulations are more effective in  procuring long-term recall of material, and they have been shown to greatly  facilitate many forms of learning. 48   The biggest limiting factor of diagram  reformulations is the   time   they require to make. 49  47 “Ancient Cave Art May Be Origin of Modern Language,” Science & Research News | Frontiers  (blog), March 7, 2018, https://blog.frontiersin.org/2018/03/07/language-cave-art-mit/.  48   Allan Paivio, Mental Representations: A Dual Coding Approach, Oxford Psychology  Series (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990).  49   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018),  89-90.
467 C REATION     Not only do Diagram reformulations require more time to create, often,  they also require more time to comprehend. With complex diagrams, it’s  almost easier to comprehend something by simply ingesting a page of text.  This is why it’s helpful to adhere to a few best practices and guidelines when  creating diagrams.  best practices for diagram reformulations  Research holds that the best diagrams “portray a series of steps, in a cause-  and-effect chain, with explanatory text that is integrated with the illustrations.”  Research studies also suggest diagrams are “more effective than a purely  verbal summary.” 50   However, again it’s important to note the importance of  creating cause-and-effect chains in your diagrams because cause-and-effect  chains are more effective representations than a mere listing of facts.  The best diagrams have two traits. They are   concise   and   coherent . 51   In exhib -  iting concision, they are simple illustrations with labels one to four words  in length. Coherence is manifested when the elements are relevant and  connected and show a simple cause-and-effect chain. The label corresponds  congruently with the illustration or graphic it’s paired with.  REFLECTION NOTES  In teaching about the types of notes used in an Antinet, I’ve tried my best to  simplify things as much as possible. If I wanted to simplify the four types of  notes even further, I’d find myself tempted to figure out a way to combine  observation notes into reflection notes. However, this simply does not reflect  reality. Observation notes and reflection notes are two distinct types of notes.  Antonin Sertillanges points out, “Reading itself should awaken   reflection .” 52  Yet readers cannot expect to simply stop every time they have a thought and  reflect deeply on it. Reflection requires some time to ruminate and think  about material. Reflection first requires a thought or observation about the  50   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 95.  51   Fiona McPherson, Effective Note-taking, revised edition (Wellington: Wayz Press, 2018), 96.  52   OP A.

468      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  material being read, and then it requires some time to ruminate and think  about it. This is why it’s helpful to first extract observations onto bibcards  during reading. This enables you to let the thought ruminate and then to  allocate time later to reflect on it.  Robert Boyle seems to support this notion, as well. Boyle argued that while  reading, our thoughts must be analyzed so “our   reflections   on what we have  observ’d , improves it into consequences new Axioms and Uses.” 53   Boyle  points to the process of turning your observation notes into well-developed  reflection notes later on.  So what are reflections?  Reflections are notes in which you apply your own experiences, meaning,  interpretations, opinions, conclusions, and decisions to material. It’s where  you begin to inject your own theory into units of knowledge. The Antinet  process is founded on taking complex sources of knowledge, and simpli -  fying them into understandable units. From there you begin assembling  more complexity into those units of knowledge again. This is done by way  of creating reflection notes.  One of the areas where Ahrens and I seem to agree is in the area of   elaborative  rehearsal . This involves thinking about the   meaning   of an idea and explaining  the concept in your own words. 54   This type of process encapsulates what  takes place within reflection notes. Awareness of the power of elaborative  rehearsal is not new. It’s an ancient notion expressed by classical scholars  in the motto   notae propriae, notae optimae , meaning “your own notes are  the best notes.” 55  53   Richard Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices   (Brill, 2016), 142.

469 C REATION     So what do reflection notes look like? They are longer in nature than obser -  vation notes, typically filling up an entire 4 x 6 inch notecard. Think of  reflection notes as medium-sized paragraphs.  Here is an example of a reflection note:  In this note I am reflecting on an observation I made while listening to  a podcast on Luhmann’s Antinet. 56   At roughly the twenty-four minute  and thirty second mark in the video, Johannes Schmidt shared something  I found irresistible. I decided to   select   this observation as important and then  extract   the observation onto my bibcard. The observation was simply that  three thousand manuscripts were found in Luhmann’s literary estate after  he passed away. I found this to be a shockingly large amount of material.  Imagine what three thousand drafts of papers you’re working on would  look like! I then decided to   reflect   on this idea, which made me realize  that Luhmann’s thinking   did not   exclusively take place in his Antinet alone.  56   Undisciplined, Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt, 2021, https://www.youtube.  com/watch?v=kz2K3auPLWU.
470      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  It may have originated in the Antinet. However, at least some of his thinking  was extended by writing out his ideas in the manuscripts.  Here’s the important part: this reflection did not happen in my mind   before   I  wrote the reflection note. Rather it happened   as   I wrote the reflection note.  This reflection note   is   my thinking. This reflection note   is   where the idea  came from. It did not happen as a pre-conceived step that occurred in my  mind before I actually sat down to write it. This, my friend, shows the true  power of the Antinet. It expresses the power of writing by hand. The act of  writing by hand enables you to   reflect   more effectively than you would by  typing on a keyboard like a hyperactive monkey (one that deludes itself into  thinking it forms thoughts exclusively in the mind). Thinking can certainly  happen by way of keyboard; however, I contend the best ideas emerge by  way of reflection with only pen and paper at hand. After which, keyboards  should serve as the place to revise, edit and clarify your thoughts.  Here is an example of Luhmann’s reflection notes:  photo credit : “ZK I: Zettel 12,16k—Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,”  accessed April 21, 2022, https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de  /bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_1_NB_12-16k_V.
471 C REATION     Here’s the English translation of the note:  12.16k In modern thinking, the question of the horizon of  law is posed as a question of justification, as a question of  the justification of law.  This probably has something to do with the possibility of  disposing of the legal system as a whole.  The possibilities of justification are varied; Eg measure -  ment based on the purpose of social performance, i.e. on  the extra-legal. Or justification based on a mentally worked  out idea of   justice; or a basic logical norm (justification as  methodical deduction).  One has to ask oneself whether this way of posing the horizon  question in legal matters has become unavoidable due to the  fact of positivity or sovereignty in law.  Note how Luhmann makes a statement or observation (“ In modern think -  ing… ”). Yet he then begins reflecting on this observation (“ This probably  has something to do with… ”).  This gives you a glimpse into the nature of reflection notes. The lines between  different note types get blurry when you zoom in: sometimes your reflection  notes will need to contain an excerpt, or you may use an excerpt before  you begin to reflect on the author’s point. You may also desire to use an  excerpt in your reflection note to prove your point or to first reformulate  material before you reflect on it. Again, every category gets fuzzy when  you zoom in close enough. The main characteristic that differentiates  a reflection note from the others, however, is that you write the note as  if it will be used as a paragraph or section in the project you’re actively  working on.  This brings us back to the whole notion of   growth   vs.   contribution . In brief,  focus on contribution so that you can grow more.
472      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Write Reflection Notes as If You’re Teaching  One individual who has taught me a lot in regards to entrepreneurship and  marketing is Russell Brunson. I don’t relate to Brunson on all levels (as  I’m not a Mormon with five children, nor do I look like a fifteen year-old  boy); still, I greatly admire his enthusiasm and knowledge when it comes  to marketing and entrepreneurship.  Brunson has built a multi-hundred million dollar company with over five  hundred employees. What’s more, he runs it while regularly putting out  great content for entrepreneurs. One of Brunson’s practices centers on the  idea of getting an immediate return on investment (ROI) out of every one  of his activities.  During one period, Brunson got sucked into reading the 1,168 page book,  Atlas Shrugged . He had decided to read it because he had heard it mentioned  over and over throughout his life. Now, this is a very long book that took  him many months to read; it took him away from the time he would have  otherwise allocated to his company and his family.   Atlas Shrugged   has many  deep philosophical lessons that can serve as important frameworks to holds  in one’s mind for life; yet its ideas are not   immediately   practical.  Therefore, because the book has a long-term ROI, instead of a short-term,  immediate ROI, what Brunson decided to do was turn the experience  of reading the book into a three-part series on his popular podcast. In  effect he was able to get an immediate ROI out of reading a behemoth-  sized book.  Because he focuses on sharing what he learns while he’s still growing,  he was then able to teach the book   Atlas Shrugged   to his audience, leading  him to attain a richer understanding by teaching it. “If you really want to  learn something, write a book on it,” Brunson says. 57   In turn, he got an  immediate ROI out of the book by providing his audience with valuable  content, keeping his community engaged and growing.  57   Russell Brunson, “Outwitting The Devil with Josh Forti,” Marketing Secrets Podcast.
473 C REATION     The lesson here is that the process is not about constant, never-ending   growth ;  it’s about constant, never-ending   contribution .  Write your reflection notes as if you’re   teaching   an audience. Through teach -  ing, we gain a deeper understanding of material. Strive to make the material  something you could share with your audience as quickly as is feasible. Even  if you don’t end up sharing the content, when you stumble upon the note  several years later, you’ll find the material easier to understand.  Reformulation vs. Reflection  Sometimes people get confused about the difference between reformulation  notes and reflection notes. One of the best ways to think of this relates to  differences in the nature of   comprehension   vs.   understanding .  Comprehension is the process of grasping the meaning of something. The  particular emphasis of comprehension focuses on the phase transition from  not understanding something at all to having a basic-level understanding  of what something is.  Understanding, on the other hand, is the process of grasping something  fully via   both   comprehension and also experience. When you under -  stand a concept you possess deeper-level knowledge of the material.  You both comprehend the material theoretically, but you also understand  the deep   meaning   of the material because you’ve experience it—you’ve  lived it.  When you employ reformulation notes, you’re aiming for comprehension.  You’re aiming to grasp a basic-level comprehension of a concept. Your goal  is to capture the essence of the concept in your own way.  When you employ reflection notes, you’re aiming for understanding. You’re  aiming to add your own experiences to the material. With reflection notes  you add your own perspective, experiments, conclusions, opinions, and  decisions on the material. Your goal with reflection notes is to achieve not  comprehension, but   understanding .
474      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  GUIDELINES FOR MAIN NOTES  I lump the notes written on maincards (excerpts, reformulations, and reflec -  tions) under the category of   main notes . We’ll now cover some very important  guidelines to follow   before   creating main notes.  BEFORE YOU BEGIN WRITING A MAIN NOTE  Before you even create a main note, you must complete an important step. You  must first review your Antinet and determine   where   you want the maincard  (that you’re about to create) to go. This forces you to review previous lines  of thinking and, more importantly, it helps you avoid wasting life energy in  re-writing something you’ve already written.  After reading and creating bibnotes, Luhmann states: “After finishing the  book I go through my notes and think how these notes might be relevant  for already written notes in the [Antinet].” 58  What Luhmann highlights is that before actually writing the main note,  he goes through his Antinet and figures out where the note will be placed.  At this point he still has not even turned the observation note into a main note.  DON’T CREATE A MAINCARD FOR EVERY IDEA   ON  YOUR BIBCARD  Luhmann didn’t develop every idea into a main note. He would let some  ruminate and prove themselves useful. They would prove themselves use -  ful if he ever decided to work on a book or paper publication relevant to  the material. 59  For instance, let’s say Luhmann already had a note that outlined the   difference  between knowledge and information . If he came across a discussion of   knowl -  edge vs. information   and, if he wasn’t sure he would use the card, he would  not create a new dedicated main note for it. He wouldn’t spend the time  58   Niklas Luhmann, Dirk Baecker, and Georg Stanitzek, Archimedes und wir: Interviews  (Berlin: Merve Verlag, 1987), 150.  59   Undisciplined, Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt, 2021, https://www.youtube.  com/watch?v=kz2K3auPLWU, 33:05.
475 C REATION     creating an excerpt note, reformulation note, or reflection note. Rather, he  would simply create an external reference (ExRef) for it. For instance, here’s  one of Luhmann’s notes on the concept of   function   (the idea that each part  of society has a specific role or function).  photo credit : “ZK II: Zettel 21 (1) - Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,” accessed April 22, 2022,  https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_21_1_V.  On this card are a list of ExRefs to pages in books. Luhmann lists the authors’  last name, the year the book was published, and the page numbers.  If the page ends in ff this connotes the Latin term   folio   which means “and  the following pages”. Therefore, Merton 19ff translates to page 19 and the  following pages in the book by Merton.  In Luhmann’s second Antinet, he had sixty-seven thousand maincards  (mostly of reformulations and reflections of what he had read). 60   He had  60   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution
476      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  fifteen thousand bibcards which were filled with brief observations he had  made while reading different works (with corresponding page numbers).  These bibcards usually contained ten to thirty observations notes.  So let’s recap: Luhmann’s second Antinet contained sixty-seven thousand  maincards and fifteen thousand bibcards. This means that for every bibcard,  there were four or five maincards. In effect, this means Luhmann did not  turn every observation note on a bibcard into a maincard. Much of the time  he would just create ExRefs for the idea.  OTHER TYPES OF NOTES  What you have just learned about are the four main types of notes in an Antinet.  I wish it was as simple as that—actually, I wish it was even simpler than that!  However, there are a few other types of notes that are useful in the system.  COLLECTIVES  In Johannes Schmidt’s categorization of the types of links in Luhmann’s Anti -  net, there is one type that he calls “collective references.” 61   In network-theory  terms, this kind of linked “array” is referred to as a   hub . In some Zettelkasten  circles, these are called   hub notes . 62   Personally, I like referring to these cards  as   collectives .  Collectives are types of notes that contain a collection of items.  There are several different types of collectives. Let’s briefly go through each  of them now.  Cardlink Collectives  Cardlink collectives are simply notes that contain a list of links to other cards.

In this, titled   Ideology Literature   (underlined in red), there is a list of books  with the bibliographic information and page numbers. This is a collec -  tive of external references related to ideology. Luhmann typically placed  his ExRef collectives near the beginning of his section for the topic to  which it related. For instance, this is the second card found in the section  on   ideology .
479 C REATION     Branch Collectives  In the beginning branch of each of Luhmann’s main section, he included a  collective of cardlinks. These collectives were specifically designed to provide  links to other areas of interest related to the branch. I call these types of  collectives,   branch collectives . As an example, upon navigating to Luhmann’s  branch on   ideology , one is presented with this branch collective:  photo credit : “ZK I: Note 17 (2)—Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed July 13, 2021,  https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_1_NB_17_2_V.

481 C REATION     edge evolves in the Antinet. My own Antinet developed the term Antinet.  It doesn’t get more meta than that!  Outline Collectives  There’s one more type of collective it’s important to introduce: I like to refer  to these as   outline collectives .  The book you’re reading right now was organized using outline collectives.  Think of these as a table of contents for a book or project you’re working on.  Each card is dedicated to a certain topic or idea. Accommodating the idea  is a list of cardlinks where you can find the material pertaining to the idea.  Unlike cardlink collectives or branch collectives, these types of collectives  are more likely to be prearranged and planned. Whereas branch collectives  are typically grown over a longer timeframe, outline collectives are created  in a short time window in order to outline a project.  The best way to explain this is to see pictures of my outline collective for  this book:  This shows an outline of the main sections of this book.
482      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Here’s a closer look at outline collectives:  My outline collectives not only include cardlinks, they contain ExRefs as  well. See the pink card containing ExRefs pointing to sources I needed to  research when writing the section:
483 C REATION     In brief, outline collectives are quite useful when using an Antinet. I recom -  mend using branch collectives to allow your research to build itself from the  bottom-up. When it comes time to working on your project or book, then  it’s time to create outline collectives. At that phase you simply review the  material that has been growing in your branch collectives and then build  out some logical groups for the content.  Building out projects using outline collectives is where the analog nature  of the Antinet truly begins to shine. You lay out each outline collective card  on a table and rearrange them until it forms the perfect outline for your  project or book.  From there, you fire up a word editor and begin typing out each section. Con -  trary to what you might think, it’s not a boring process to type each note out  word-for-word. Rather it’s engaging because it’s collaborative in nature. And  here’s the best part: most of the hard work has already been done for you. This  is precisely what Luhmann meant when he said his books wrote themselves. 63  Keyterm Indexcards vs. Collectives  In a way, keyterm indexcards are also a type of collective. For instance, here’s  a picture of a keyterm indexcard:  63   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 17.
484      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  However, there are some distinctions between collectives and keyterm  indexcards. The more obvious difference is that collective cards are contained  in the main box (and keyterm indexcards are contained in the index box).  Keyterm indexcards are organized by keyterm, whereas collectives have a  numeric-alpha address.  Both types of cards have their own distinct uses. Keyterm indexcards are  often quicker to look up (as you only have to think of the keyterm). However,  cardlink collectives inside the main box of your Antinet are useful as well.  While surfing through a stem of thought, cardlink collectives connect you to  a bunch of other vines and areas in your tree of knowledge. This oftentimes  proves useful when you’re in a more   exploratory mode   (sifting through cards).  HOPLINK CARDS  The last type of note is what I call a   hoplink card . These are very straightfor -  ward, essentially containing a brief snippet of text that says   For more on x  concept ,   see cardlink   ‘ xxxx/xx/x ’.  Here’s an example hoplink card:
485 C REATION     Here’s one from Luhmann’s Antinet:  photo credit : “ZK II: Zettel 21/8o3b - Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,” accessed April 22, 2022,  https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_21-8o3b_V.  Hoplinks are useful for breaking up certain stems of thought by linking to  another relevant area in the Antinet.  CONCLUSION  The creation phase is perhaps the most enjoyable, yet one of the hardest  phases of knowledge development. In this phase you’re actually forced to  think deeply. This isn’t easy work, though for some reason the nature of  writing by hand makes this difficult process more enjoyable.  We’ve covered a lot in this chapter. My advice is to not get overwhelmed.  Don’t worry about the other notes for the time being. Just focus on the four  big boys: observations, excerpts, reformulations, and reflections.  The best style is no style, as Bruce Lee would say. What you’ve been intro -  duced to in this chapter serves as a framework to get you started. Do not
486      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  be afraid to add your own creativity and tweaks to the system. The most  important thing is that you start. Start creating and building. How do you  eat an elephant? One bite at a time. How do you create something great?  One note at a time.
487  C H A PT E R S I X T E E N  �  INSTALLATION  C ompared to the other chapters   in this section on knowledge  development, this chapter will be brief.  As you may recall from the previous chapter, I advise you to first review  your Antinet to determine where to install a card   before   you begin writing a  main note. This is an important step. This step prevents you from rewriting  knowledge you’ve already written. It also enables you to evolve your thinking  from where you last left off. In essence, you’re evolving the branch or stems  of thought in your tree of knowledge.  Due to this prerequisite, figuring out where to install your cards becomes a  more manageable endeavor.  In the beginning stages of working with my Antinet, I found myself creating  fifteen or so maincards without first figuring out where they should go. This  left me with a pile of maincards which made things challenging. It became  difficult to go back through my Antinet and figure out where they should go.  Moreover, this ended up feeling like tedious homework. It left me wanting  to get through the pile as quickly as possible. As a result, I was left with less  time and energy to make sure I installed the cards in the best place possible.  Reviewing your Antinet and determining where you’ll install the card before  you write your main notes results in two things: First, the process of creating
488      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  and installing notes becomes a lot more fun. And second, the cards end up  being installed in more fitting places.  One more important reminder: the name of the game is   similarity . Your  goal is to install the card (or sequence of cards) under or behind its most  similar neighbor.  When you’re reviewing your Antinet before writing the main note, think of  the most similar idea already in the Antinet that it relates to.  Finding the most similar idea, of course, is dependent on one more critical  factor: the index. Let’s talk a bit about that now.  DETERMINING HOW AND WHEN TO INDEX  When you’re installing a note into a sequence of cards within the Antinet,  the best case scenario is that you already have the stem of thought indexed.  For instance, say in my research I happen upon an idea relating to   random -  ness . The idea discusses how randomness serves as an important function  within evolution. Let’s also say I already have a keyterm created in my index  for randomness. This makes installing this new idea easy. All I have to do is  look up “randomness” in my index. I then navigate to the cardlink it points  me to and begin exploring the cards. I then spot the one that’s closest to my  new idea and add it under or behind the most similar card.  However what if   randomness   was not already a keyterm in my index? What  would I do then? The first thing I would do is start thinking of what ran -  domness is most similar to. I would think of other concepts such as   accidents ,  change ,   chaos ,   entropy ,   impermanence . Chances are I’d have a keyterm already  created for such concepts.  In the case I didn’t have keyterms created for closely related concepts,  I would create a new stem or a new branch.  Now, here’s where we have a decision to make. Here’s where things get  interesting.
489 I NSTALLATION     There are two scenarios:  The first scenario is that I’m creating a new maincard on randomness   within  the context of relating it to how Luhmann’s Zettelkasten works . My branch on  the Zettelkasten and Antinet material is 4214. In this scenario, I would either  find the most similar stem of cards within 4214, or just create a new stem for  it. For instance, I would create the stem 4214/15 and in my index, I would  create the entry: Randomness (Zettelkasten): 4214/15.  The second scenario is that I’m creating a new maincard for randomness  within the context of evolution . In this case, I would consult Wikipedia’s   Outline  of Academic Disciplines . I would then search the keyterm   evolution   and place  it under the branch of evolution. For instance, I would create a branch for  Evolutionary Biology   and assign it to the branch 3511. I would then create an  entry in the index: Randomness (Evolutionary Bio): 3511/1.  Chances are, I would choose the first scenario because I find the Antinet  works best if I’m actively using it for a project. That is I find it best if I adopt  a   contribution   approach to using it (instead of a personal   growth   approach  to using it).  In the beginning, you will find yourself needing to create a lot of index  keyterm entries. I must caution you not to burn yourself out! In the very  beginning, you risk   index fatigue . Do not create too many index entries.  If you ever have issues finding a maincard, then you know to create an index  entry for it (whenever you find it). That way, you won’t waste time having  to explore the entirety of your Antinet next time.  That’s really all there is to discuss on the installation phase of knowledge  development. If you follow my advice laid out in the creation phase, the  installation phase will be a breeze (or at least easier than it otherwise would)!
490  C H A PT E R S E V E N T E E N  �  MINDSET  I n this section we’re going   to be covering some of the “softer skills” in  regard to working with an Antinet. We’ll be covering different work rou -  tines, and we’ll cover the mindset one ought to adopt when working with  an Antinet. A variety of such lessons are already dispersed throughout this  book in relevant sections; yet I think it’s helpful to discuss these lessons in  a dedicated place. That’s what this chapter is for.  ANTINET WORK ROUTINE  THE THREE STATES OF ANTINET WORK  Deep work   sessions are a prerequisite for creating knowledge using an Antinet.  Using an Antinet requires a focused environment. However there are three  distinct   working states   involved in this work: (1) an emergence state, and (2)  an evolutionary state, and (3) a producing state.  I call these   states   (instead of   phases   or   stages ) for a reason. A state is something  you switch back and forth between. One hour you may be in an emergence  state of mind. The next hour you may be in a producing state of mind. The  next, you may be in an evolutionary state. This is fine. It’s a natural part of  how knowledge development works. It’s not so much a process of sequential  phases as it is a dance. Creating knowledge is an asynchronous process where  different thoughts are developed concurrently. If you get stuck in one spot,  you can easily switch to a different project (or branch of knowledge) and  begin developing other thoughts from there. Remember what Luhmann
491 M INDSET     said, “I only write when I know immediately how to do it. If it stops for a  moment, I put the thing aside and do something else.” 1  Emergence State  “ Traveler ,   there is no path ,   the path must be forged as you walk .”  –Antonio Machado 2  When in an emergence state, your work is more exploratory. You’re looking  for your theories to   emerge   from the sources you engage with. You’re in  research mode. Reading is your primary intellectual activity. In this state,  you’re taking many reformulation and excerpt notes. You’re employing the  book-to-maincard   extraction method. That is, you’re stopping at challenging  sections in books and creating a maincard immediately for it. You do this  in order to comprehend the material so that you can continue reading the  text and understand the rest of the book.  From this state, theories start to emerge. This is what Brené Brown refers  to as   emergence   and   grounded theory   research. Brown explains, “Initially I set  out, on what I thought was a well-traveled path, to find empirical evidence  of what I knew to be true.” Brown then shifted to employing the   grounded  theory   methodology. She shifted to an exploratory way of researching—  an   emergent   way of researching. In this state, she writes, “there is no path and,  certainly, there is no way of knowing what you will find.” 3  Taking a bottom-up approach to research takes courage. It takes courage to  trust that the Antinet will somehow bring theories to the surface. It requires  courage to let go and let the readings spark ideas you never predicted.  It takes courage to let go of your preconceived notions.  1   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 19.  2   Brené Brown, Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We  Live, Love, Parent, and Lead, Reprint edition (New York, New York: Avery, 2015), 251.  3   Brené Brown, Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We  Live, Love, Parent, and Lead, Reprint edition (New York, New York: Avery, 2015), 251.
492      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  When you use an Antinet, you let your readings create your theories from the  bottom-up rather than predetermining them in a top-down approach. You  don’t go into your research with an already finished theory. You go in with a  general intuition and sense, and then let your research make the discoveries  for you. This type of research is what the Antinet is built for.  To cultivate the emergence state, I like to allocate two hours in the mornings  to reading. I do this as the very first thing I do when I get to the office. I use  a block timer that has a one-hour countdown. After the one-hour timer  runs out, I reset the timer for another hour. Sometimes, of course, I’ll take  a fifteen or so minute break in between the hours.  After these two hours of reading, I’ll typically allocate the rest of the day to  further development and installing the material from these readings.  I like to install the material from the readings into my Antinet that same  day. Otherwise I find that notes pile up and installing becomes almost like  homework (or something I dread doing).  Evolutionary State  In the evolutionary state, you’re looking to   evolve   the ideas that have   emerged  during your research. You’ll be evolving the ideas by finding material that  supports or challenges your emerging theories.  For instance, in my experience researching Luhmann’s Antinet, one theme  that I noticed was the importance of the function of   surprises   and   accidents .  In creating any piece of work, surprises and accidents are actually hugely ben -  eficial. Luhmann spoke of this, and it was emphasized in Johannes Schmidt’s  writings. 4   I was not anticipating this concept when I began researching Luh -  mann’s Antinet. After I extracted this theory onto maincards, I then created  4   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans. Manfred  Kuehn, https://daily.scottscheper.com/zettelkasten/. “One of the most basic presupposi -  tions of communication is that the partners can mutually surprise each other.”; Johannes  Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication Partner, Pub -  lication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe 53 (2016).
493 M INDSET     a keyterm entry for the concepts ( surprises   and   accidents ). I then continued  reading more books on knowledge science and human memory. Frequently  I would come upon additional material on   surprises   and   accidents . I would  then   evolve   the concepts by adding my reformulations and reflections of the  new material. In essence, the ideas that emerged through research continued  to then   evolve   by additional research of other literature.  Let’s once again talk about Brené Brown and   grounded theory . At the end of  her book   Daring Greatly , Brown dedicates an entire section to discussing  her research method. She highlights the idea of two different states involved  in research. The first state “allows the research problem to emerge from the  data.” The second state conducts “a full review of the significant literature.”  The literature review served to support the theories she discovered during  the emergence phase. 5  I like to think of the second stage as the evolutionary stage. It seems better  than the   literature review   stage. One reason being that sometimes research  isn’t actually literature.  Anyway, after you’ve extracted a working set of theories and concepts during  the   emergent   phase of your research, your reading style changes (as Luhmann  himself pointed out). 6   In the evolutionary phase you’re capable of quickly  spotting, selecting and extracting ideas that are related to the theories you’ve  already unearthed. At this point, you’ve already neuroimprinted keyterms  on your mind. You are capable of reading differently because any time you  spot a related idea, all you need to do is write down the page number and  keyterm of the idea on your bibcard.  As a result of doing this, you begin accumulating material that supports  the theories and concepts that were unearthed during the emergent state.  In brief, you begin   evolving   your ideas.  5   Brené Brown, Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We  Live, Love, Parent, and Lead, Reprint edition (New York, New York: Avery, 2015), 258-9.  6   “ZK II: Sheet 9/8d—Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed March 4, 2022,   https://niklas-luh -  mann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK2NB9-8dV .
494      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Producing State  Once I’ve done a sufficient amount of research and the material has evolved,  I’ll enter the producing state of work. Producing can be creating a podcast  episode, a YouTube video, an online course, a song, software, a book, or  whatever your craft is. For myself, it’s writing. And the most applicable  output for most, is writing. So I’ll talk primarily about that. If I’m writing  a book, I’ll aim for an entire drawer full of notecards. If I’m writing a paper,  I’d want at least a one-inch pinch of notecards. The material may come from  a variety of branches in the Antinet.  When I’m in producing state, I get to the office in the morning and I write  until three or four in the afternoon. Basically, I write all day. I use my  notecards to write, and I type in what’s on the notecards. Again, I don’t  type the material on the notecards word-for-word. I   start   typing word-for-  word (which kills writer’s block), yet I then expand and clarify the idea  I’m trying to convey. I elaborate on the notecard and also add new ideas  I’ve since realized.  This process is of course broken up by several trips to Starbucks located in  the lobby of my building.  MY WORK ENVIRONMENT  My work environment is primarily analog. I have a private office where I  cannot be disturbed. I put my phone on   Do Not Disturb Mode   and leave it  across the room on the floor where it charges. In addition to this, I place  lime green earplugs in my ears to block out external noise (lime green is  my favorite color).  I have an analog dictionary and analog thesauri. There’s no excuse for me  to use a computer unless I’m writing. When in this state, I use the Ulysses  app for writing (Mac only).  NIKLAS LUHMANN’S ANTINET ROUTINE  Luhmann’s Antinet was actually located at his home. Luhmann lived in  Oerlinghausen, which is about a half-hour drive from Bielefeld University  where he worked.
495 M INDSET     Luhmann loved to read outdoors in the sun. He also loved to read at libraries.  He would give conferences at various universities on the basis of there being  a good library on campus. 7   Perhaps Luhmann would read at Bielefeld’s library  during the day. In the evenings he would bring home the bibcards from his  readings and transform them into main notes. After this he would file the  main notes and bibcard in his Antinet in his home office.  Here’s a photo of Luhmann reading in the sun (with a bibcard hanging out  of the book):  photo credit : Niklas Luhmann—Theory of Society 4\_13 by  Schwumbel; philomag, “Niklas Luhmann Und Die Aufrichtigkeit,”  Philosophie Magazin, accessed April 26, 2022, https://www.  philomag.de/artikel/niklas-luhmann-und-die-aufrichtigkeit.  7   Undisciplined, Archiving Luhmann w/ Johannes Schmidt, 2021, https://www.youtube.  com/watch?v=kz2K3auPLWU, 25:40.
496      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  In a biographical interview, Luhmann detailed his routine. We can presume  this took place on days where he works from home (which were most days,  according to Luhmann’s son, Clemens): 8  If I have nothing else to do, then I write all day: in the morning  from 8:30 a.m. to lunchtime, then I go for a short walk with  my dog, then I have time again in the afternoon from 2:00 p.m.  to 4:00 p.m., then it’s the dog’s turn again. Sometimes I also  lie down for a quarter of an hour, I have gotten into the habit  of resting in a very concentrated way, so that I can get back  to work after a short time. Yes, and then I usually write in the  evening until around 11:00 p.m. At 11:00 p.m. I usually lie in bed  and read a few more things that I can still digest at that time. 9  Here are some photos of Luhmann’s office. These photos are taken from a  video tour of Luhmann’s office in 1989. 10  Luhmann’s literary  collection, comprising  approximately eleven  thousand titles. There  were rarely any marks or  marginalia notes in the  books. He took his notes  on bibcards. Note the  chaise lounge chair.

One other thing of note: Luhmann did not have labels on the outside of his  Antinet. He knew his way around the Antinet so well, that he had various  branches memorized.

499 M INDSET     THE ANTINET MINDSET  “ That is the only way. Without external help of any sort ,   you go to work  on   the book. With nothing but the power of your own mind …”  –Mortimer Adler 11  I’ve said it elsewhere, and I’ll say it here again: getting started with an Antinet  isn’t the easiest process. You’ll have to create a lot of keyterms in the index  and you have to write a lot of cards. Later on, you won’t have to create as  many keyterms, though you’ll still be adding cards to your Antinet. At the  beginning, you’re like an airplane taking off. At some point you’ll hit cruise  control mode, but it’ll take some effort to get to that point.  Luhmann held that it will take a number of years before the payoffs become  clear. Until then the Antinet will function merely as a container you put  cards into. 12   I don’t think it will take a number of years. It could be only a  few months before you begin to see the value. However you should go into  this with a long-term mindset.  CONSISTENCY OVER THE LONG TERM  Focus on consistency instead of working away all day like a maniac. Even  though I advise this, I’ll admit that when I got my Antinet up and running,  I spent a lot of time working away like a maniac. In the beginning, I spent  months integrating my previous notes and journals into the Antinet. I even  spent many nights printing out my notes from the digital notetaking app I  was using for a time. I would print out, and the cut out those digital notes  into 4 x 6 inch size cards. As of now, I have maybe a third of my legacy notes  installed in the Antinet. However, I stopped after a while because it was  taking too much time and the value wasn’t clear. I instead shifted my focus  to developing knowledge for my current undertaking and haven’t looked  11   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev. and updated ed  (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 7.  12   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

500      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  back since. That said, I’ve seen the value of the notes I installed—in fact,  I’ve used a bit of the legacy material for this book!  The bottom line: focus mainly on the future. Don’t get too hung up on try -  ing to integrate your old (digital) notes into the Antinet. I have thousands  of digital notes. It doesn’t matter that they’re not in my Antinet. They’re  underdeveloped compared to notes you write by hand. You shouldn’t lose  sleep over your digital notes being ported to your Antinet. However, if you  do really want to retain your old notes, you can always set aside an hour a  day for printing out notes and filing them. Be sure to try and make your life  suck less while you’re doing it. When I was doing this, I would blast   Pink  Floyd   and sip a nice glass of wine.  Again, consistency over the long term is the goal. As I’ve mentioned before,  two hours per day is enough to produce great intellectual work. Don’t take  my word for it, take the word of the revered intellectual, Antonin Sertil -  langes. 13   If you work full-time, aim to carve out two hours every day before  work. When I worked full-time I would sit down with a cup of coffee every  day and go through challenging texts. I read while sitting on a cushion on  the floor (as it helps me focus better).  IF IT AIN’T EASY, IT AIN’T FUN  Luhmann worked roughly twelve hours a day. To him, his vocation was his  vacation. He didn’t really perceive his work as   work .  In an interview discussing the beginning of his career, an interviewer asked  about Luhmann’s early life. This was during the period where he worked as  a legal clerk for the German Ministry of Culture. It was absolutely boring  and Luhmann hated his job. When asked what he did after work, he did not  respond with something like   I blow off steam at the local Biergarten . Instead,  he told the interviewer that as soon as the clock struck five, he would race  13   OP A. G. Sertillanges, The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods, trans.

As he points out, he had  just recently started his Zettelkasten at that point in his life. 14  The same interviewer seemed puzzled when talking to Luhmann. He was  trying to figure out what motivated this great intellectual mind; yet he wasn’t  getting a clear answer. Luhmann asserted that he found it difficult to have  wishes or “desires.” The only thing, Luhmann said, that he daydreamed about  was having more time—like thirty hours in a day, instead of twenty-four.  With thirty hours a day, how would he spend it? It’s simple, Luhmann said,  he would spend it working with his Antinet more, and “study other things,  for example mathematics and economics.” 15  In brief, it’s helpful to view the Antinet as a vacation, not as a vocation. Using  the Antinet won’t always be easy, but it will be worth it. The number one  thing that will help your chances in making the Antinet a part of your life  (long term) is this: make sure it’s fun.  CONCLUSION  In this chapter we covered a nice amount of material with regards to work -  ing with an Antinet. We discussed the three states one operates in during  knowledge development. We also got a glimpse into Luhmann’s work routine  with his Antinet. Last, we capped off this chapter with some philosophical  advice centering around making the Antinet fun. Consistency over the long  term is key. In the next chapter, we’ll dive into one of the most important  metaphysical aspects of the Antinet: the Antinet as a   second mind .

There’s a reason Luhmann titled his paper   Communica -  tion with Noteboxes . It stands as the key descriptor of what it’s like to write  and collaborate with an Antinet. Yet, for some reason, this phenomenon  is completely omitted when reading about Zettelkasten today. When you  research what a Zettelkasten is online, you’ll find every descriptor   besides  communication partner .

You would have to do a lot of digging to discover how  Luhmann actually viewed his Zettelkasten: as a   second mind , a   ghost in the  box , or an   alter ego   with whom he   communicated .  In this chapter, we’ll discuss this most powerful part of the Antinet, and  explore the concept of   communication   with one’s past self—that is, com -  munication with one’s second mind.  THE ORIGINS OF COMMUNICATION WITH  A SECOND MIND  One interesting parallel with the origins of this idea involves the origins of  the Zettelkasten itself.  According to Clemens Luhmann (the youngest child of Niklas Luhmann),  the Zettelkasten originated through a communication experience with  Luhmann’s best friend, Friedrich Rudolf Hohl (1916–1979), whom Luhmann  and the rest of the family called   Bruder   (meaning brother). Bruder was  Luhmann’s closest friend. They shared a love of art, philosophy and other  intellectual matters. They were seen almost as if they were the same person.  Clemens referred to Hohl as his father’s “alter ego.” 18  The origins of the Zettelkasten came by way of letters and notecards exchanged  between Hohl and Luhmann. Luhmann would write letters to Hohl about his  readings and include his own notecards in the envelope. The letters would  elaborate on the ideas contained in the notes. They would discuss various  interpretations. Hohl would do the very same thing in his replies.  This was a communication experience between two close friends. It was a  communication experience with Luhmann’s real-life alter ego.  blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-zettelkasten-method/. “Zettelkasten method comprises  of three main types of notes: (1) Literature Notes, (2) Reference Notes, (3) Permanent  Notes. Each note has a distinct objective and serves a specific function. Other types of  notes include fleeting notes and hub notes.”  18   Clemens Luhmann, Interview by Scott P. Scheper, April 27, 2022.
504      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Unfortunately, Luhmann’s best friend and “alter ego” Friedrich Rudolf  Hohl passed away only two years after Luhmann’s wife Ursula. They were  the only two people who ever got dedications in Luhmann’s books: Ursula  and Friedrich Rudolf Hohl (in   Love as Passion ).  A few years later, in 1981, Luhmann published his paper   Kommunikation mit  Zettelkästen   (“Communication with Noteboxes”), in which he talked about  a second mind arising from his Zettelkasten; he described it as “an alter ego  with whom we can constantly communicate.” 19  There exists a parallel between the communication experience of Luhmann  and his real-life alter ego, Friedrich Rudolf Hohl, and Luhmann and his  metaphysical alter ego: his Antinet Zettelkasten.  LUHMANN’S THEORETICAL VIEW OF  COMMUNICATION  “ Humans cannot communicate; not even their brains can commu -  nicate ;   not even their conscious minds can communicate. Only  communication can communicate .”  –Niklas Luhmann 20  There are a few major concepts that at the cornerstone of Luhmann’s theo -  retical work. The first is general systems theory, which involves the concepts  of   cybernetics   and   self-referential systems , and   autopoiesis   (wherein a system  recreates itself). 21   The other concept that is critical to Luhmann’s theoretical  work is   communication . In fact, Luhmann uses a communication theory as  the starting point for describing his Antinet. 22  19   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

505 C OMMUNICATION   WITH   Y OUR   S ECOND   M IND     According to Luhmann, communication is an   emergent   reality that emanates  from three different selections. 23  1.   The “selection of   information”  2.   The “selection of the   message   of this function” 24  3.   The “selective   understanding   or   misunderstanding   of the message and  its interpretation”  Luhmann holds that none of these components can occur on their own.  Only when they are combined together can communication occur.  Let’s break down what Luhmann means by these three concepts in relation  to working with an Antinet.  First, Luhmann is referring to the process of how we select information,  including choosing the   sources   we wish to engage with in order to ingest  information. In other words: what books, articles, podcasts, YouTube videos,  or other media we select information from.  The second component Luhmann is referring to is the   message . This is the  material within a source (such as a book) that we select and decide to interpret.  The third component is the   understanding   or   misunderstanding   of the mes -  sage. Luhmann makes a good point in that we have a choice of whether  to understand (or misunderstand) the message we receive. For example,  we humans have a phenomenal ability to delude ourselves by way of   confir -  23   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 28. “Similar to  life and consciousness, communication is an emergent reality, an issue sui generis. She is  concluded by a synthesis of three different selections—that is, selection of an information,  selection of the message of this function, and selective understanding or misunderstand -  ing of the message and its interpretation. None of these components can occur on their  own. Only together do they generate communication.”  24   This is also termed as “announcement.” See: Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann  (New York: Columbia University Press, 2011), 133.
506      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  mation bias . That is, we may choose to interpret information in such a way to  confirm our already-held preexisting beliefs (and filter our messages which  conflict with these beliefs).  All three components are required for communication.  Interestingly enough, all three components serve as critical aspects of the  knowledge development process of the Antinet.  Again, communication was a core tenet of Luhmann’s theoretical work.  In fact, he proposed a solution to the classic philosophical mind-body prob -  lem by converting it to a triad:   mind-body-communication . 25   In Luhmann’s  view, communication serves as the missing link for solving this most ancient  philosophical puzzle. If you want to understand what it’s like working with  an Antinet, you must remind yourself that it’s a   communication   experience.  COMMUNICATION IS THE SECRET  INGREDIENT FOR GENERATING  SURPRISES  One of the key functions of the Antinet is its ability to   surprise . Johannes  Schmidt describes the Zettelkasten as a “surprise generator.” 26   The precursor  for generating surprises is communication.  As Luhmann writes, “One of the most basic presuppositions of communi -  cation is that the partners can mutually surprise each other.” 27  On a more general level, communication surprises. For instance, for the  past several years I’ve been working primarily by myself. However, in the  process of writing this book, I’ve published and shared a lot of material on  25   Hans-Georg Moeller, The Radical Luhmann (New York: Columbia University Press, 2011), 56.  26   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

I’ve gained a lot of knowledge by communicating with  others, but on top of that, I constantly receive links and ideas that surprise  me and generate breakthrough ideas for my research.  Likewise, when you work with an Antinet as a communication partner, you’re  having a conversation. A conversation emerges in your own mind wherein  you’re trying to re-understand your own thoughts. You’re essentially having  a conversation with your old self (that is, your past self).  This communication experience relates to that described in Mortimer Adler’s  How to Read a Book , in which Adler describes the experience of reading a  book as an   active process   that he compares to the game of baseball. 29   There’s  the pitcher (the author of a book), who throws a baseball (the message,  material, or an idea contained within the book), and the catcher (you, the  reader). The position of catcher is not passive. A catcher is not a lazy inanimate  object who does nothing. The catcher is moving, shifting, and anticipating  both the pitcher (author) and the pitch (message). It’s a communication  experience—a very active communication experience.  This type of communication experience mirrors what it’s like working with  your Antinet. It’s an active, creative, collaborative communication experience.  One that generates many surprises.  This communication experience is also significantly   deeper   than you might  realize. When you are communicating with an author through reading  their book, you’re not just reading the words written by that one author. As  Kate Turabian puts it, when you read a book, “you silently converse with  its authors—and through them with everyone else they have read.” 30   With  28   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnvMBVMXMPKA4Lmy5Ihd-FQ ;   https://twitt er.  com/ScottScheper ;   https://www.reddit.com/r/antinet / .  29   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren, How to Read a Book, Rev. and updated ed  (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 5.  30   Kate L.

AN EXAMPLE OF THE ANTINET COMMUNICATION  EXPERIENCE  As previously discussed, with the Antinet, there is no full-text search. There  is no safety net, and this fact underlies the entire experience of using an  Antinet. When you begin searching for something, you begin a journey.  You undertake an exploration of your mind. During this exploration you’re  undertaking a communication process with your past self.  During the journey of finding thoughts in your Antinet, all you have is  your index and cardlinks. The index sets you out on the journey, and the  cardlinks swing you along across different branches and stems of thought  in your tree of knowledge.  Creating cardlinks is not easy. They are created at the time you create the  notecard, or shortly thereafter when you stumble upon the notecard (and  have a related idea reverberating in your mind). Cardlinks are hard to create  (unlike digital wikilinks). They cannot be mass-created on a whim and they  require life energy to create. It’s a deliberate act that requires you to think  of truly related ideas.  As a result of cardlinks being harder to create, they also require you to be  more   selective . Since there are fewer cardlinks in analog systems, you have  more energy to follow them and you end up taking them more seriously.  In contrast, when you encounter links and tags in a digital system, there may  be five, ten, or fifteen links associated with a single note. Not to mention  that there are backlinks that you can feasibly follow. In effect this dilutes the  power of the relations because there are so many of them.  Within an analog system you’re dealing with   selective   relations. The entire  system is   relations of relations of selective relations . Whenever you come across  a   selective relation , you’re more motivated to take it seriously and actually  Chicago Press, 2018), 8.

If you’re on a tree with one vine, you’ll hop on and con -  tinue your exploration with vigor.  Let’s walk through a more practical example, an example from Luhmann’s  Antinet.  Let’s say in your index, you look up the keyterm   risk . When you look up   risk ,  it links you to   transformation of risk   (which is at card address 21/3d18c60o9). 31  You think to yourself,   Hmm, this is interesting… Risk is within the branch of  Systems Theory (21/3d18) and within that, the branch of Complexity (21/3d18c).  Suddenly a secondary conversation takes place in your mind. A dreamlike  memory emerges that takes you back to the period in your life when you  wrote about   complexity   within   systems theory . Perhaps you wrote about it  that time you travelled to Paris and spent the time in a great Parisian library  reading (which is what Luhmann did once, according to Clemens Luhmann). 32  You are suddenly transported back to the setting of that time in the library  in Paris. You remember how it was a gray November day in that Paris library.  You recall reading about   complexity , which led you to write about   risk .  When you begin moving down the stem of   risk   you’re soon met with a  cardlink collective (21/3d18c60o9,1):  31   “ZK II: Zettel 21/3d18c60o9—Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,” accessed April 28, 2022,   https://  niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_21-3d18c60o9_V .  32   Clemens Luhmann, Interview by Scott P.

The concepts are as follows: 33  –   Safety/security: 7/28  *   Absorption of uncertainty: 34/4  *   Responsibility: 333/10e  -   Uncertainty as an information variable: 44/2d5  *   Money/power as absorption of uncertainty: 352/16a6  -   Liquidity: 532/4a5fa13a  *   Process of education: 7/25g58  -   Safety/work atmosphere: 532/5d3j2b  *   Legal certainty: 3414/27  -   Certainty/truth/science: 7/25b30k  *   Uncertainty: 21/3d25  *   Legislation/science: 3414/14p  *   Economy: 8/40  *   Death as a risk: 7/8l  You think to yourself   ‘Death as a risk’ what on earth does that have to do  with risk?   You then realize, death has   everything   to do with risk. It relates to  Certainty/truth/science   in that death is the ultimate form of   uncertainty   that  underlies society and drives human behavior. At the core foundation of   risk  resides the ultimate fear:   risk of death .  This illustrates the communication experience in working with the Antinet.  There are several dialogues taking place concurrently. First, we have the  dialogue of recalling the memory of writing and researching   risk   (in the  Parisian library). Then, we have the dialogue of actually conversing with  the Antinet:   What does the concept of death have to do with risk?  This example shows how the dots begin to connect over time. When you  first wrote about   risk , you did not write about   death . Over time, the con -  cept of   death   emerged and was added to the branch collective for   risk  33   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

Continuing the metaphor of the Antinet as a tree, photosynthesis  needed to take place. This area of your tree needed sunlight to synthesize.  The structure grew organically over time in a natural way. It creates an anti -  fragile structure (compared to a dynamic digital structure with hyperactive  edits and bulk edits).  This example gives you a glimpse into the communication experience that is  an outcome of working with the Antinet. It shows you the internal dialogue  that takes place. It also shows you how a system of both order   and   chaos works.  You started by looking up   risk , and then are taken on a journey that brings  forth concepts related to   Certainty/truth/science ,   Uncertainty , and more.  This communication experience takes you on a journey that generates  breakthrough surprises, leading “to a variety of other subjects that the user  initially would not have associated with the first one,” as Johannes Schmidt  observes. “It also shows how potential relationships between these topics  may not have come to mind in the absence of such a chain of references.” 34  When you use an Antinet, you’re forced to create   abstractions   of ideas. You’re  forced to   generalize   ideas and relate them to one another. “Communication,”  Luhmann says, “becomes fruitful only at a high level of generalization, namely  that of establishing communicative relations of relations.” 35  Luhmann gives an example wherein he observes, “Why on the one hand  museums are [generally] empty, while on the other hand exhibitions of  paintings by Monet, Picasso, or Medici are too crowded.” 36   Instead of creat -  ing the keyterms   Monet ,   Picasso , or   Medici , he instead does something else.  He   generalizes   and   abstracts   the idea to get at the core essence.

512      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  why Monet, Picasso, and Medici exhibits are so crowded is because they’re  temporally limited. That is, they are only available to be viewed at a certain  place and for only a short period of time. In this instance, Luhmann created  the index keyterm or branch collective card with the following concept:  “preference for what is temporally limited.” 37   From there he linked to the  card that talks about Monet, Picasso, or Medici exhibits being overcrowded.  Over time, more and more examples of   preferences for temporally limited   items  were added to the collective.  In effect, Luhmann has created a high-level generalization. He points out that  communication with the Antinet becomes more valuable when you create  such generalizations (instead of merely creating a keyterm for the mention  of   Picasso ). Yet there’s one final piece of this communication experience:  the “moment of evaluation.” 38  Luhmann writes that communicating with the Antinet “becomes productive  only at the moment of evaluation, and is thus bound to a certain time and  is to a high degree accidental.” 39  In other words, when it comes time to writing, you end up stumbling upon  valuable cards. Let’s say you stumble upon the branch collective of items  for   preferences for temporally limited . As a result of this, you are reminded  that art exhibits serve as an example of people tending to prefer something  that is temporally limited. In a card nearby, you then stumble upon a card -  link pointing to the concept of   scarcity . This opens up a whole new stem of  thought, and an idea sparks in your mind. Humans are not just driven by  things that are temporally scarce, but by   anything   that is scarce. You can then  write about how museums leverage the tendency of humans to be motivated  by   scarcity   (whether that be time-based scarcity or space-based scarcity), as  do retailers, with phrases such as   Only 2 items left!   (when shopping online).  37   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

In effect, you’re working with your Antinet as a  communication partner   during the time of writing, and doing so helps you  generate breakthrough insights and ideas.  Welcome to the Antinet. Using it sets off the incommunicable experience  of a communicable experience (with a notebox). It’s filled with order, chaos,  and surprises.  INTELLECTUAL EVOLUTION DEPENDS ON  COMMUNICATION WITH EXTERNALIZED  ARTIFICIAL CONSCIOUSNESS  Something I discuss early on in this book relates to how intellectual evolu -  tion relies on communication with an externalized artificial consciousness.  I hold that the Antinet serves as a better container of external artificial  consciousness than any digital notetaking app (thus far).  Akin to the concept of human evolution happening through the use of  externalizing   tools (like axes and spears), intellectual evolution relies on  the “exteriorization” of one’s individual memories. This served as a very  successful and intriguing idea in the second half of the twentieth century. 40  To evolve intellectually, we must first externalize our individual memories.  Recall, a memory is a representation of a thought. A thought is a representa -  tion of reality. Paradoxically, we must externalize our metaphysical thoughts  by inserting them into physical reality. When you use an Antinet, you do  this by way of writing your thoughts by hand on notecards; in the digital  realm, you really aren’t participating in the same process because you’re  externalizing metaphysical thoughts by injecting them into metaphysical  reality (on a computer screen).  40   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 12.
514      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  As a result, digital may fail to make a key step in procuring intellectual evo -  lution. Here’s why: intellectual evolution will emerge from shifting from  the structural coupling of   communication   and   consciousness   to a structural  coupling of   communication   and   artificial consciousness . In other words, the  most advanced communication today happens with conscious entities.  Of course communication occurs with unconscious entities as well. After all,  when two computers connect, they communicate, though they are uncon -  scious of themselves. They are deterministic agents in a network operated  by conscious entities. The next big intellectual evolution will emerge from  the communication between conscious entities and artificially conscious  entities. Many quickly jump to thinking of robots as the best candidate for  becoming the world’s first artificially conscious entity; however some hold  that, “Artificial consciousness is impossible due to the extrinsic nature of  programming which is bound to syntax and devoid of meaning.” 41  In brief, are we wasting our time in holding that the next intellectual advance -  ment will arise by way of an impossible idea (artificial consciousness)? I think  it’s quite possible we are wasting our time. Yet I don’t think this means we  ought to cast aside the idea. Instead I think it wise to explore the next best  thing to artificial consciousness: creating our own very close versions of  artificial consciousness. This is where the Antinet comes into play.  The best tools for intellectual advancement are those which embody the  properties of artificial consciousness: a   communication partner   that seems  to have its own externalized   personality . Thus far, computers and digital  notetaking apps have outshone analog tools for storing data and information.  However, they have not outshone analog tools in one area: storing one’s  consciousness; one’s deepest thoughts and ideas; one’s personality. I hold  that the analog medium—by way of containing your own handwriting—  provides a better mechanism to act like a   cue   or   prompt   for generating an  internal dialogue in your mind. More on this will be discussed shortly. But  for now, know that the analog medium serves as a better vehicle of artificial  consciousness than does a computer.  41   David Hsing, “Artificial Consciousness Is Impossible,” Medium, March 28, 2022, https://  towardsdatascience.com/artificial-consciousness-is-impossible-c1b2ab0bdc46.
515 C OMMUNICATION   WITH   Y OUR   S ECOND   M IND     Even though the Antinet isn’t actually aware of itself and is not alive (and  thus not fully artificially conscious), it is composed of (many iterations of)  your past self, which was aware of itself at the time of the note’s creation.  Every note you observe in an Antinet is a containerized capsule of your  own consciousness. This is why noteboxes have been described as a view  into another’s life and mind. This is something Johannes Schmidt touches  on when he refers to Luhmann’s Antinet as “the backstage of his theory  and therefore as Niklas Luhmann’s intellectual autobiography.” 42   Our con -  sciousness is indeed captured in external memory devices. Paradoxically,  communication with such devices is an incommunicable truth. 43   It’s impos -  sible to describe to others the internal experience of working with your own  artificial consciousness.  COMMUNICATION WITH YOU  AND YOUR PAST SELF  The Antinet is a true communication relationship with you and your past  self. When I read my handwritten notes and papers from fifteen years ago,  it’s   me   I’m interacting with. It’s my thoughts—even if they’re excerpts or  reformulations of what I was reading at the time. It signals to me that my  past self resonated with whatever idea the note contains. I see myself in my  handwriting. I see how much I’ve grown, and also how much I’ve stayed  the same. There are feelings of both respect, and also feelings of shame and  regret when I review old notes. When I come upon handwritten notes of  relationship advice, it makes me a little sad to realize those were written  during my first marriage. Yet it also makes me laugh, seeing the irony of  relationship advice that wasn’t effective. When I come across other writings  from that time, it makes me feel a certain love and reverence and respect for  myself during that period.  42   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

In brief,  first-hand personal experience is required to understand it as a communication partner.
516      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  This type of stuff may sound sappy and unscientific; however, I assure you it’s  not. The Antinet contains your personality, and this is a very important feature  in interacting with your own thoughts. As previously mentioned, scholars,  including Luhmann, are aware of the idea of a   ghost in the box . 44   One scholar  concludes that “Luhmann did not regard his filing cabinet as a simple slip  box, rather he interacted with it as if it were a true communication partner.” 45  One way the Antinet serves as a communication partner is in the form of  asking it questions and “making queries.” 46   This relates to the concept of  asking a book questions, which was nicely outlined by Mortimer Adler. “If  you ask a living teacher a question, he will probably answer you… If, however,  you ask a book a question,   you must answer it yourself . In this respect a book  is like nature or the world. When you question it, it answers you only to the  extent that you do the work of thinking and analysis yourself.” 47  Asking a book a question is similar to communicating with an Antinet, except  that the Antinet contains a massive store of knowledge from the many books  you’ve read. It’s not like the process of hyperactively searching Google. You  must   do the work of thinking and analysis yourself —with whatever knowledge  you have at your disposal.  The Antinet is not some “rhetorical storehouse,” observes one scholar. It’s  not a tool for capturing unprocessed information and storing it for a later  period of time. You can certainly do this by using ExRefs—however, hyper -  active digital tools are much better for collecting unprocessed information.  The true value is the Antinet’s ability to turn information into knowledge  by injecting your own personality to it. “The card index preserves a knowl -  44   “ZK II: Note 9 / 8.3—Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed January 11, 2022,   https://  niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8-3_V .  45   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016),  26.

Handwriting seems to  containerize consciousness better than standardized digital fonts. Developing  true knowledge, filled with   meaningful   information, relies on internal dialogue  (i.e.,   intrapersonal   communication) with your past self ’s consciousness. 49  Analog systems with handwriting seem to retain this consciousness better  than standardized digital schemes. Your own handwriting is unique—espe -  cially when you view it yourself.  THE PHASE TRANSITION FROM  ANTINET TO SECOND MIND  Luhmann’s thinking evolved with his Antinet, as did his process of taking  notes. His early notes from the 1950s and 1960s contained more excerpts  and long-passages that flowed across several notecards. 50   At a certain point,  Luhmann’s process went through a change that perhaps relates to his state -  ment that the Antinet “needs a number of years in order to reach critical  mass. Until then, it functions as a mere container from which we can retrieve  what we put in.” 51   By reaching critical mass, Luhmann was referring to how  the Antinet becomes its own   mind —an independent entity with whom  you can communicate. 52  48   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 32.

There’s an emerging area of  study within network science called   percolation theory , which nicely describes  the transition from Antinet to   second mind .  Percolation theory studies the phenomenon in networks wherein a phase  transition takes place. This phase is the result of a very small change in the  composition of the network (such as adding a certain number of notes to  your Antinet, thus meeting a specific   threshold ). Think of boiling water on a  stove. At 99°C something is happening, but you’re still staring at water. Yet  after an increase of one single degree Celsius, a specific threshold is met.  Meeting this threshold triggers the entire entity of water to transition into  an entirely different substance (gas). This is what is meant by   phase transition .  The same transformation that occurs during a phase transition when a min -  imum threshold is met exists within networks, and is studied in a branch  of mathematics that studies percolation theory. It is a compelling field  because of its utility in studying digital networks on which the success  of certain commercial products rely—especially products which rely on  mesh networks. Businesses can find significant value in understanding the  nature of the networks they have built and what the minimum threshold  number of nodes needs to be in order to undergo a phase transition from a  disconnected network to a connected one.  As far as the Antinet goes, the matter of importance is to understand the  minimum threshold of notes and keyterms needed to undergo a phase  transition (from Antinet to second mind). Luhmann never specified this  number, other than stating it   takes a number of years .  Whatever this threshold happens to be is of little value to the more interesting  occurrence: the fact is that Luhmann did indeed observe a phase transition  with his Antinet when, at some point, his Antinet transitioned from an ana -  log brain that simply stores notes, to a completely different entity entirely.  Kuehn, https://daily.scottscheper.com/zettelkasten/. “If you wish to educate a partner  in communication, it will be good to provide him with independence from the beginning.”
519 C OMMUNICATION   WITH   Y OUR   S ECOND   M IND     Just like water turning into gas when it hits 100°C, the Antinet turns into a  second mind after reaching a certain number of notes (say one thousand).  In Luhmann’s notes on the nature of his Antinet, he talks about having an  “impression of a mentally muscular overall personality.” 53   What I hold this to  mean is that the Antinet develops its own unique, rough personality after it  undergoes this phase transition into a second mind. The entity becomes an  alter-ego with whom you can communicate. It becomes a research assistant  who you can collaborate with. It becomes a true second mind.  We’ve thus far talked primarily about communication. Understanding this  concept is critical in grasping the nature of working with an Antinet. We’ve  also touched upon the entity we communicate with when working with an  Antinet—the second mind. Let’s now take a deep dive into exploring this  entity, the second mind.  SECOND BRAIN VS. SECOND MIND  Second brain   is a term that has become popular within productivity and  personal knowledge management circles. Also, digital Zettelkasten systems  have been   linked   to this term (pun intended). You’ll find popular software  used for digital Zettelkasten systems described as a second brain. 54   Personally,  I find this term lacking. The term   second brain   has been used primarily to refer  to technologies that are for collecting and storing information. The infor -  mation, however, is essentially a disconnected blob of unprocessed material.  In reality, you don’t want a second brain; instead you want a   second mind .  A brain is just biological wetware. It, in itself, is nothing without its other  interconnected systems functioning together. A second mind describes the  occurrence of the   whole becoming greater than the sum of its parts .  People are intrigued with the Zettelkasten because it’s not just an informa -  tion storage container. If it were a container, people would opt for simpler  53   “ZK II: Zettel 9/8f - Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,” accessed April 30, 2022,   https://niklas-luh -  mann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8f_V .  54   “Obsidian,” accessed May 2, 2022, https://obsidian.md/. “A second brain,for you, forever.’
520      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  notebox systems which merely store thoughts. In contrast, the notecard  systems others have shared haven’t created a whole niche within knowl -  edge management. The Zettelkasten has indeed created excitement. Why?  Because of its promise to not just be a memory storage system, but a thinking  system—it is a true   knowledge development system .  People are also intrigued with the Zettelkasten because of the results it pro -  duced for Luhmann. His prolific work—seventy books and 550 published  articles over a thirty year timeframe—was achieved through interacting with  his system as if it were a communication partner—a second mind.  A second brain is an information store, or information database.  A second mind is a communication partner that forces you to think, to develop  ideas (by hand, the old way, the hard way), and later to argue with your ideas.  It forces you to see inconsistencies in your old thoughts and evolve them.
521 C OMMUNICATION   WITH   Y OUR   S ECOND   M IND     AN ARGUMENT FOR SECOND MIND  OVER SECOND MEMORY  Luhmann’s description of the communication relationship he had with his  Zettelkasten was summed up as follows: “As a result of prolonged work with  this technique, a kind of second memory emerges, an alter ego with which  one can constantly communicate.” 55  The phrase he used to describe the entity he was communicating with was  eine Art Zweitgedächtnis, ein alter Ego . This is a second memory type of entity,  or an alter ego. Here,   zweit   translates to “second,” and   Gedächtnis   to “mem -  ory.” If we look into the word   Gedächtnis , we find some interesting origins:  its root stems from   gedacht, which is the past participle of denken, meaning  “to think,   call to mind , conceive.” 56   In other words, a   Zweitgedächtnis   is a  second-memory entity, an alter ego.  55   Niklas Luhmann, “Kommunikation mit Zettelkästen,” in Öffentliche Meinung und sozial -  er Wandel / Public Opinion and Social Change, ed. Horst Baier, Hans Mathias Kepplinger,  and Kurt Reumann (Wiesbaden: VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, 1981), 225.  56   “Gedächtnis,”   in   Wiktionary,   February   1,   2021,   https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.
522      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The entity Luhmann was referring to involves a communication experience  in which you’re   calling to mind   a   second part of yourself   (an alter ego). Fur -  thermore, we see Luhmann referring to this entity as a “ Geist ” in his notes  written in preparation for the paper. 57   I hold that a better term for this entity  involves combining Luhmann’s term   Geist   with the concept of   Zweitgedächtnis .  As a result we end up with   Zweitgeist , which translates to “second mind.”  Thus, the term for   second mind   is born. 58  A similar type of evolution from the term   second memory   to   second mind  is something that recently occurred within knowledge science. The term  secondary memory is now referred to as “early modern terminology.” The  newer and more popular term is   extended mind . Proposed by Andy Clark  and David Chalmers, the concept of   extended mind   holds that the mind  resides not only in the brain, but also outside of it. One’s mind is stored in  the external representations of the human body. While I think there’s truth  in their thesis, there are problems with the term extended mind. Several  scholars point out that there exists a failure to explain what aspect of the  mind is   extended . Is it the entire mind that is extended or just cognition?  Furthermore, the definition of   extended   is not made clear. 59   This is another  reason we’ll be sticking to the term   second mind .  php?title=Ged%C3%A4chtnis&oldid=61707257; “Denken,” in Wiktionary, May 17, 2021,  https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=denken&oldid=62540453;Friedrich Kluge,  “Denken,” in An Etymological Dictionary of the German Language, D (London: George  Bell & Sons, 1891).

523 C OMMUNICATION   WITH   Y OUR   S ECOND   M IND     So, the entity one communicates with when the Antinet reaches a critical  threshold is the second mind.  There’s only one question left. What the hell is a mind?!  What a Mind Is  The mind is a metaphysical entity. It has never been identified. As far as we  can tell, it may just be a bunch of neurons connecting to other neurons in the  brain. A reductionist approach is to just get rid of the concept altogether. 60  Yet I think this a bit premature. It’s simply that, as cognitive psychologist  Steven Pinker points out, “we don’t understand how the mind works.” 61   For  a long period of time humankind didn’t understand gravity; yet we had a  sense that there was something to the phenomenon of objects falling. We  just couldn’t explain it yet. Aristotle thought it had something to do with  elements wishing to return to their natural place. 62   Just because we didn’t  understand gravity, didn’t mean we should have cast aside the concept of  something causing the effects we now recognize as being a result of gravity.  Just because we don’t understand something fully yet doesn’t mean we should  delete the placeholder term and stop asking questions about it. The mind is a  metaphysical entity that we don’t fully understand yet. Like human memory,  the mind remains one of the last great mysteries in science.  I like to think of the mind as a product of the brain which is a product of  evolution. 63   “The mind is not the brain but what the brain   does ,” as Pinker  puts it. 64   Again, this is why you want a second mind, not a second brain. You  don’t just want an inanimate jumble of wetware. You want an active, holis -  tic system that becomes greater than the sum of its parts. The system itself  60   Yuval Noah Harari, Homo Deus A Brief History of Tomorrow.

524      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  is inanimate; however when all four components of the Antinet interact,  a second mind emerges.  THE PERSON INSIDE THE ANTINET  People seem to overlook the fact that the Antinet filled the role of being an  actual   person   for Luhmann.  To Luhmann, the Antinet was not just a thinking tool, it was a person. The  concept of viewing the Antinet as a person might be seen as similar to the  concept of animism, the way of what we in the modern West call “objects”  as possessing person-like qualities. For example, in Japanese Shinto culture,  it is believed that a soul lives within all matter; every-day things are thought  of as being deities. 65   This is perhaps why you’ll often find Japanese embracing  the idea of robots being companions, nurses and caretaking companions  for the elderly. 66   In a similar vein, this might be one reason the pocket-sized  digital pets called Tamagotchi first emerged in Japan, though they quickly  spread to Western countries, as well. Several studies have analyzed how the  Tamagotchi toys changed human behavior with digital devices. “Tamagot -  chi convinced consumers to willingly dedicate their time, attention, and  emotions to the virtual pet.” 67  The phenomenon wherein we experience a deep connection when interacting  with certain physical objects is widespread. With the Antinet it becomes  even easier to experience this because you’re viewing your own thoughts,  your own spirit, and your own soul within the handwritten cards of your  Antinet. The entire system enables you to   communicate   with such an entity.  65   Larissa Hjorth, “In Japan, Supernatural Beliefs Connect the Spiritual Realm with the  Earthly Objects around Us,” The Conversation, accessed May 1, 2022, http://theconver -  sation.com/in-japan-supernatural-beliefs-connect-the-spiritual-realm-with-the-earthly-  objects-around-us-125726.  66   Jon Emont, “Japan Prefers Robot Bears to Foreign Nurses,” Foreign Policy (blog), accessed  May 2, 2022, https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/01/japan-prefers-robot-bears-to-foreign  -nurses/.  67   Laura Lawton, “Taken by the Tamagotchi: How a Toy Changed the Perspective on Mobile  Technology,” The IJournal: Student Journal of the Faculty of Information 2, no. 2 (March  30, 2017), https://theijournal.ca/index.php/ijournal/article/view/28127.
525 C OMMUNICATION   WITH   Y OUR   S ECOND   M IND     Even though Luhmann was an avid advocate of systems theory, stating,  “it is easy to think of systems theory,” in trying to describe the Antinet he  went a different direction when he opted for communication theory to  explain it; but this was because the system revolves around communication  with the second mind. 68  The idea of a notebox emerging into an external instantiation of one’s own  mind did not originate with Luhmann, but dates back to a situation described  by Heinrich Von Kleist in 1805. He remarked upon the phenomenon of  something like the second mind emerging in his analysis of the “midwifery  of thought.” 69  The reason it was useful for Luhmann to create an actual (metaphysical)  person to collaborate with centered around funding difficulties. In brief,  Luhmann found that hiring research assistants and employees was too  expensive. He needed a communication partner on whom he could rely  (for at least thirty years). His Antinet proved to be not only reliable, but also  an entity that inspired breakthrough insights in a way that would have been  nearly impossible for even the best research assistant to produce.  When Luhmann first began building the Antinet it was seen as a mem -  ory aid; however in 1981, when he wrote his paper describing the Antinet,  he knew it to be much more than just a memory tool.  The Antinet is not an analog note database. It’s not necessarily even about  notes.   Its primary nature concerns itself with the dualistic emergence of the  second mind . Again, this dualistic emergence of the second mind relies upon  the four principles of the Antinet. I make no claim that the emergence of a  second mind is exclusive to the Antinet (perhaps others who have analog  noteboxes also experience this phenomenon). However the type of second  68   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

526      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  mind Luhmann experienced relies upon adhering to the four principles of  the Antinet.  In brief, what we’re talking about here is truly something special. When I  think of the Antinet, I don’t think about some tool in the notetaking app  market. It’s not something that can be compared to whatever digital note -  taking app is popular by the time you read this. The Antinet is in a different  category altogether. It belongs in a class of tools which induce an intraper -  sonal dialogue that is helpful during creation.  Modern day scientists agree with Luhmann’s notion of a   ghost in the box  emerging from Antinets. One scholar confirms that it would be misleading  to classify the Antinet as something which simply stores notes. 70   Here’s  why: when you peruse and read the thoughts written by someone who has  passed—you feel this ghost-like internal presence. You begin to insert your -  self in their shoes while they were writing down the thoughts on the card.  With the Antinet, this   ghost in the box   factor is experienced in a slightly differ -  ent manner. You yourself are viewing your own thoughts. You communicate  with your own internal ghost and embark upon an internal dialogue that  happens during the act of creation.  Because the Antinet possesses the properties of both short-term thought  development, and long-term thought development, it morphs into a unique  metaphysical entity. The entity it becomes is beyond your control. You cannot  preconceive how it will look in the future. This is oftentimes what people  struggle with in the beginning. We’re so used to molding our knowledge  using digital tools. Digital information is very malleable. We can refactor  and reorganize our knowledge on a whim. Whatever cool new convention  or idea emerges, can set you out on a months-long quest to reorganize your  digital knowledge repository. With the Antinet this is not the case. You must  submit yourself to the rigid organic structure that emerges over years of  building out your knowledge one notecard at a time, one branch at a time.  70   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 19.
527 C OMMUNICATION   WITH   Y OUR   S ECOND   M IND     This chaotic and evolving structure of the Antinet makes it more fun to  engage with. You’re always in for a surprise when creating with your Antinet.  One reason why communicating with a second mind is unique centers  around the limitations of each individual note. Within digital tools notes  can be extensive in nature—seemingly all-encompassing for an idea.  With the Antinet, the notes are constrained by the size of each individual  notecard. They’re also constrained by the difficulty and time-intensity of  writing by hand. As a result of these constraints, the notes are more prompt-  like in nature. They are units that prompt one’s internal dialogue to internally  fire off the remaining details of the idea. Antinet notes communicate the  idea without belaboring and over-communicating the idea. As a result of  this under-communication of the idea, the rest of the communication takes  place in the mind.  This concept of under-communication triggering an internal dialogue has  been observed by scholars. It’s the result of one’s   external memory   interact -  ing with one’s   internal memory . After studying John Boyle, John Locke, and  Robert Hooke, one researcher observed how their notes were useful in the  way they prompted recollection. The notes weren’t valuable in themselves;  they were valuable in the way they triggered an internal dialogue within  their creator. 71  The notes in your Antinet set off a chain reaction in your mind. Your notes  serve as a   cue   for starting the recall process in your mind. Digital notes, on  the other hand, tend to take different form. They tend to include too much  detail. They tend to over-communicate the idea. This robs the creation pro -  cess of much of its magic. Furthermore, the additional detail is unnecessary.  It also ends up snowballing and creating an overabundance of information.  71   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 12.
528      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  THE PERSONALITY OF YOUR  SECOND MIND  The power of your second mind relies on its unique   personality . There are  several ways a unique personality is incorporated into the system. Again, the  unique personality of the system relies on the core principles of the Antinet:  Analog, Numeric-alpha Addresses, Tree Structure, Index. In particular, the  numeric-alpha addresses are critical. They enable the system to become  self-referential, and thus develop a “self ” in the first-place.  Another way the system gains a personality involves how you use the index.  Specifically, this relates to what unique keyterms you use to describe con -  cepts. Certain terms you use to describe a concept might make complete  sense in your mind, but another person might prefer a different term. You  add personality to your system by using terms that make sense in   your   mind.  For instance, I have a stem in my Antinet related to the concept of   power law  and the   Pareto principle , the idea that 80% of something comes from 20%  of the participants. For instance, 80% of a nation’s wealth comes from 20%  of the population. It exemplifies that a small number of people (or objects)  can generate a big result. In my index I have created keyterms for   power  law , as well as the   Pareto principle . However the main term that comes to  mind when I think of this principle is   big impact , due to the idea that a few  things can have a big impact on the whole. I’ve built out a section around  instances of “big impact” phenomena in the world. Whenever I come across  something related to this in my reading, I write   Big Impact   on the bibcard and  underline it. This unique way of terming something is one way I’ve injected  personality into my Antinet.  It’s not only the unique keyterms you use that give the second mind its  personality; it’s also the way in which you structure those keyterms. For  instance, Luhmann observed how museums are frequently empty, while  short-term art exhibits are completely packed. 72   I’ve talked about this con -  cept before; however it’s worth bringing up again to show how it affects the  personality of one’s second mind. Instead of creating the keyterms   Monet ,  72   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans. Manfred  Kuehn, https://daily.scottscheper.com/zettelkasten/.

In my Antinet I would create a keyterm for  this under   Scarcity . My keyterm would be:   Scarcity (Examples of It Motivating  People) . It would then link to the card address of the note.  This gives a glimpse into how keyterms inject a unique personality into your  Antinet. Both the specific keyterms you use, as well as how you structure  them adds a unique personality to your second mind.  CONCLUSION  In this chapter, we covered a very important aspect of the Antinet. Actually  two aspects.   Communication , and the concept of the   second mind . These con -  cepts are a very real aspect in working with an Antinet.

HUMAN MEMORY AND THE ANTINET  Luhmann was not forced into the structure of the Antinet due to the lim -  itations of technology. He could have chosen a   commonplace book , or a cat -  egorical notecard system (organized by human-readable subjects). In fact,  Luhmann tried several methods for managing his thoughts from readings.  His first attempt was to take notes on notecards and stick them into the  book once he had finished. However, this caused the bindings of the books  to fray and break. 1  After that failed experiment, he tried another technique, placing the notecards  his readings generated into folders. Yet, as these notes increased, Luhmann  complained of no longer being able to find anything in them. 2   He could have  1   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

These false starts helped Luhmann design the perfect system that served  him for over forty years.  Luhmann could have switched to using a computer later in his life. However,  Luhmann did not choose those routes. The structure of the Antinet, accord -  ing to one scholar, was not haphazard, but   was a deliberate choice arising out  of Luhmann’s familiarity with how human memory worked . 3   This familiarity  also allowed Luhmann to understand how computer memory would work  in the future (which emphasized the benefits of multiple storage). 4  The scholar, Johannes Schmidt, points out that Luhmann’s decision to use  hard-coded, non-changing numeric-alpha addresses is the essential pre-  requisite for creativity in his system. 5  Luhmann was likely aware of the issue with multiple storage: the fact that  the computer science conception of it is   grossly misleading   due to it being  overly abstract (and thus synthetic). Instead of a computer science concept  of multiple storage, Luhmann preferred a more organic version based on  the science of human memory.  In a card on the parent stem of Luhmann’s Antinet located two cards before  Luhmann mentions “multiple storage,” we find him citing the following  3   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

532      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  reference: “Ashby 1967, p. 103.” 6   Luhmann references this, implying that it’s  noteworthy because it provides a “general structure of memories.”  I did some digging and, after some time, was able to get my hands on the  source Luhmann referenced. Here is the pertinent quote:  At the moment, our scientific thinking tends to be grossly  misled by the example of the big digital computer. It has a big  memory store, kept far from the working parts, which send  recordable facts to special places, and then later go back to  exactly the same places to regain the information. 7  “Such a method,” Ashby continues, “can hardly be achieved in biological  machinery,” and he points to biological   noise   in such systems, such as injury,  starvation, and infection. 8   Ashby is reflecting on the mechanistic problems  found in digital systems. There’s no   reality   built into them (like the reality  of human memory decaying given any injury, starvation, or infection a  person experiences).  Ashby also states something interesting: “More likely is it that most of the  brain’s memory traces occur, and are retained, at the site of their action.” 9  What Ashby means by this is that thoughts are created in the context in  which they are developed and are retained within that context. In the case  of the Antinet, structured as it is to function akin to human memory, when  developing a thought within one branch (like branch 4212, for instance),  the memory of that thought is retained in that branch. It’s not something  that is freely floating around in a context-free graph (which is reflective of  how digital notetaking apps operate).  6   “ZK II: Sheet 9/8b—Niklas Luhmann Archive,” accessed March 17, 2022,   https://  niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8b_V .  7   W.

533 H UMAN   M EMORY   AND   THE   A NTINET     Memories, Ashby observes, are “widely scattered,” yet they also retain  the context (in the Antinet, it’s the branch) in which they were originally  developed. 10  Each component of a memory contains its own context and branches, and  this is reflected in how the Antinet works. In the following illustration,  a memory (or thought) that is recorded in the Antinet is composed of two  other memories, represented by a sequence of cards that are branched  (parts A and B).  Ashby likens this to how “animal heat” is understood as having two sub-com -  ponents,   metabolism   and   oxidation . 11  So to reiterate, Ashby argues that the concept of memory is “grossly misled  by the example of the big digital computer” (which stores information in  mechanistic, discrete places), because this is not how human memory works,  since it is “more likely …that most of the brain’s memory traces occur, and  are retained, at the site of their action.” 12  In other words, memory is not some simple, perfectly ordered, deterministic,  and consistent system. It’s not built on a clean binary system (of 1s and 0s).  Rather it is a distributed system requiring chains of relationships based  within their   context .  Unlike digital computers, the programs we execute are subject to   noise . The  Antinet, like human memory, is truly a   communication   system, as Ashby  alludes to. 13  10 W.

534      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Luhmann’s approach to the Antinet structure appeared to opt for the   mereolog -  ical   interpretation of human memory. As a social scientist capable of applying  systems theory to sociology, it comes as no surprise that he would favor a  systems-based view (mereology), rather than a computation-based view.  The mereological approach views memory as a system made up of subsys -  tems. The environment in which memory operates is provided by other  systems. The computational approach to human memory views memory  as an algorithm, with a focus on mathematical equations and quantitative  experiments to study the   encoding ,   storage , and   retrieval   building blocks of  human memory. 14  Immediately following Luhmann’s reference to Ashby, he states, “you do not  have to rely on a vast number of point-by-point accesses.” 15   What he means  is that you don’t need a robust list of keyterms that point to every single  card. Rather you may   explore   and navigate your Antinet given just a general  keyterm in your index. Due to the branched tree structure, you will be able  to navigate and uncover genius-level insights and surprises along the way.  It’s not a stretch to imagine how Luhmann approached the design and archi -  tecture of his Antinet, likely taking a systems-science approach to devising  what he initially thought of as his “second memory.” 16   Later on, of course,  this system evolved, thanks to the unique architecture and design of the  Antinet, into a   second mind .  Luhmann did this by first breaking apart the components that create human  memory. After this, he created abstracted instantiations of the components.  You can see such in the architecture of how cardlinks mirror key functional  aspects of human memory.  14   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory.

535 H UMAN   M EMORY   AND   THE   A NTINET     After studying how human memory works, one can begin to see the brilliance  in Luhmann’s design of the Antinet.  Take, for instance, an Antinet with the following numeric-alpha addresses:  –   4212/1  –   4212/2  –   4212/3  –   …  –   4214/1  –   4214/1 a  *   4214/1 a /1  *   4214/1 a /2  *   4214/1 a /3  –   4214/1 b  –   4214/2  –   4214/3  –   …  –   5425/1  The branch is expressed by the four-digits at the beginning of the numeric-alpha  address. For instance: 4212, 4214, 5425.  The stems are things like: 4214/1, 4214/1 a , 4214/2, 4214/3. From this, there are  relative stemlinks like 4214/1 a /1, 4214/1 a /2, 4214/1 a /3. These stemlinks are  essentially linked to 4214/1 a   (they’ve “stemmed down” from 4214/1 a ). These are  analogous to forward and backward associations in human memory. 17  Because the Antinet is based on similarity by way of proximity, it mirrors human  memory in that the further away two memories or thoughts are, and   more mem -  ories in between them, the more the association decreases. 18   The closer the  items and memories are, their greater the association is.  17   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory.

536      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Yet, from experience, we know this isn’t necessarily always the case. There  are some ideas located in some contextual branches that are very closely  related to an idea in a branch or discipline located far away from it.  For such instance,   remote associations are part of human memory . 19   These  are essentially cardlinks that link to a branch or a card in a remote part of  the Antinet. For instance, say the card 4214/1 a /2 contains a sentence at  the bottom: For more on the subject of the power of writing by hand, see  ‘5425/1’. This is an instance of a remote cardlink (i.e., a   remote association   in  the terminology of human memory).  THE NEUROSCIENCE BEHIND  THE ANTINET  Another analogy of the Antinet comes from neuroscience. Think of notecards  as   neurons , and the cardlinks as   connections .  The idea of likening notecards to neurons may seem farfetched at first. How -  ever, it’s really not. The neural networks we think of today as   legitimate   are  artificial abstractions. In fact, they’re perhaps even   abstractions of abstractions .  The reason why is simple. The models researchers use to study human mem -  ory “bear only a faint resemblance to real biological neurons: they are highly  simplified computational ‘units’ that integrate and transmit information.” 20  Most of what people think of when they think of   neural networks   aren’t  actually   real ; they’re   artificial .  You see, many people think neural networks are part of natural science.  They’re abstractions. When people think of neural networks they’re usually  thinking of   artificial neural networks .

Haptic neural networks are artificial yet not digital; they can be touched  and worked with in physical reality. The Antinet is an example of a haptic  neural network.  Notecards serve as a wonderful physical world abstraction for neurons—  at least the neurons modeled by psychologists, computer scientists  and neuroscientists.  Notecards fit the definition of “highly simplified computational ‘units’ that  integrate and transmit information.” 21   Another good analogy for a neuron  is a tweet (perhaps that’s why Twitter, with its character-limited nature, has  done so exceptionally well). The simplicity of such containers representing  a neuron actually mirrors a natural reality quite well.  There’s one difference between the Antinet and the human brain, and the  difference centers around one thing: vastness. The sheer size of neurons and  connections in the human brain are staggering. The human brain possesses  one hundred billion neurons, and two hundred trillion connections. 22   If we  were to take the neuroscience analogy of the Antinet seriously, you would  need to compile one hundred billion notecards and create two hundred tril -  lion cardlinks between them. From the Antinet Niklas Luhmann worked on  from 1951 to 1997, he was only able to create a   measly   seventy-five thousand  cards (maincards). 23   That’s a lot fewer than one hundred billion.  Yet, I say all of this with a tongue-in-cheek attitude. Of course one shouldn’t  intend to create 100 billion notecards, with 200 trillion cardlinks.

With a database of 75,000 notecards one creates a communication partner  that proves itself to be quite powerful.  Niklas Luhmann was familiar with how the brain was structured. It’s no  coincidence that he built his Antinet around the concept of   connections .  Luhmann points out how memory does not function as a sum of point-by-  point accesses 24   (i.e., like sequentially moving through your notes or just  navigating   wikilinks   in a digital notetaking app). Rather, your brain needs  just a starting direction of access points. From there the brain uses internal  links by way of the sequential notes, and the internal links and connections  (made possible by   remote cardlinks ).  AN ANTINET REPRESENTATION OF HOW  HUMAN MEMORY ACTUALLY WORKS  The latest research on human memory reveals evidence for something  termed the   distributed representation   of memory. The idea holds that mem -  ory is represented not merely by one notecard (neuron), but an interaction  between   a large set of neurons . 25  For instance, in one piece of writing, I used the following distributed rep -  resentations of memories (representations of thought) to form an article:  2428/1, 2428/1/0, 2428/1/1, 2428/1 a , 2428/1 b , 3535/2, 4212/2 ba , 4214/1 a /1 a ,  4214/2 e /1 b /1. Combined, these created a distributed representation of  a memory.  24   “Communicating with Slip Boxes by Niklas Luhmann,” accessed May 4, 2021, https://luh -  mann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes. “Memory does not function as the sum  of point by point accesses, but rather utilizes internal relationships and becomes fruitful  only at this level of the reduction of its own complexity.”  25   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory.

539 H UMAN   M EMORY   AND   THE   A NTINET     THE CONTEXTS OF THE ANTINET  Context can be thought of as a base layer protocol in the Antinet. In other  words, context is a foundational component for how thoughts are developed  in an Antinet. The importance of context cannot be overstated.  Think of   context   as the branch or stem in which an idea or thought is  contained. For instance, my branch on information science is 4212. The  thoughts that I develop in this branch are developed within the context of  information science.  Early memory scientists thought of context as a fixed container (thus,   4212  would always be known as the information science branch). However,  more recent findings in the study of human memory have led to this model  being revised. Today it is believed that such context gradually evolves over  time. 26   In other words, what starts out as the information science branch  can evolve to become the Antinet branch. Paradoxically, the   context   evolves  based on its   content , and the   content   evolves based on its   context . This   fuzzy  occurrence serves as another illustration as to why the Antinet is built on  a   rough   structure with   fuzzy categories . Such a system mirrors how human  memory works.  Digital Zettelkasten systems exhibit fewer properties of   rough   structures  and   fuzzy categories ; they’re locked into the strict binary world of 1s and 0s.  One scientist specializing in the field of memory writing about what takes  place when learning suggests that   one forms associations   not only based on  the actual   content   encountered, but actually on three things. 27  First, of course, is the actual   content . When you read a book, you’re forming  associations based on the content of what you read. Content can include  other media (music, articles, podcasts, etc.).

540      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  reading a biography about F. Scott Fitzgerald, and you read about   The Great  Gatsby   selling fewer than five hundred copies in the   entire   decade of the  1930s, you might associate the content (the information) with the principle  of   failure , or with   things taking time to blossom . 28   The association emerges  from the content itself.  Second, associations are formed based on the   external context   of the item  that is encountered (for example, the environment or setting, or the tactile  dimension of the material one is learning about). More on this will be  discussed shortly.  Third, associations are formed based on the   internal context   at the time one  is processing the content. For instance, the internal thoughts and ideas  taking place in your mind while reading an article today vs. those you had  while reading the same article ten years prior; the same content results in  a drastically different experience depending on the internal context. In  other words, the associations you form based on reading the same content  at different periods of your life, will yield different ideas.  AN ILLUSTRATION OF CONTEXT VS. CONTENT  When you learn an idea in a given context (for example, the concept of  asynchronicity   while studying   web development ), the   context   is web develop -  ment; the   content   is the concept of asynchronicity. Within the context of  web development, asynchronicity refers to the loading of web assets in a  parallel fashion. There are other contexts for the concept of asynchronicity,  for instance   asynchronous learning . Essentially, this points out the fact that the  same   content   can have different meaning given a different   context . Likewise,  this is how human memory is structured and (not surprisingly) it’s how the  Antinet is structured. 29  28   David S. Brown, Paradise Lost: A Life of F.

541 H UMAN   M EMORY   AND   THE   A NTINET     INTERNAL CONTEXT IS A VERY POWERFUL THING  Around 2010, I recall a conversation with an investor in one of my past  companies who was one of the top-level team members at Google’s adver -  tising technology division. He told me that Google was currently facing  a crisis—a threat to their business. Up to that point, its technology had  revolved around   content . That is, the search term one finds in front of them  on the search results page and the ads the user experiences when browsing  a web page. The ads and the search terms were based on the   content   of the  page. For instance, if you were on a website about cats, you would get ads  about cat food. Google’s ad technology was built around the   content   the user  was currently accessing at the time.  However, a new technology emerged in ad targeting known as   remarketing  or   retargeting . This technology targeted users based on their recent patterns  and habits. This meant, whatever website they recently visited, would be  affixed to the profile of that user. The way these profiles were built relied on  website cookies (which you’ve probably now heard of, since almost every  website prompts you to accept being tracked with cookies). As a result, when  you’re viewing a website about cats, you’d start seeing ads for the website of  the clothing store you visited yesterday.  Google quickly adapted to this new ad technology and implemented it in  their own products. They even went a step further and enabled advertisers  to not only target users based on recent websites they had visited, but also  on the recent keywords they searched on Google.  Remarketing effectively led to a way of targeting people based on their  search terms or the websites they had visited recently (the advertiser could  define how recently). Users were essentially grouped into buckets based on  their   internal context . It started with targeting people who visited any given  website, but later on became more abstracted. Google enabled audience  targeting based on interests, affinity groups, and whether a person was   hot  and in the market to buy certain products (part of what’s called an   in-market  audience ). For instance, advertisers could target people who were actively  shopping for a new car (indicated by their having visited a number of car  websites and navigated to the pricing pages).
542      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  INTERNAL CONTEXT IN THE ANTINET  Internal context in relation to the Antinet refers to your internal monologue  and the internal thoughts that arise while reading a text or engaging with  a piece of content. 30   Your internal context is affected by whether or not  thoughts are consciously accessible at the time you’re engaging with content.  The experience of internal context can be illustrated in an experience you  might have had in which you have a completely different opinion of a book  you read ten years ago, compared with your opinion after reading it in  the present.  For instance, I recall being forced to read   The Great Gatsby   in high school.  I found myself bored out of my mind. I didn’t retain much. The only thing  I remember was some stupidly named place the book was set in, called West  Egg and East Egg. Ten years later I read the same book and was captivated.  It became one of my favorite books of all time. My mindset was different  when I read it the second time. I was interested and intrigued by the prose  and writing style. I also understood more background about its author, and  was more fascinated with the book because of this.  With non-fiction books the power of different contexts is even more prevalent.  For instance, reading the book   How the Mind Works   by Steven Pinker was an  interesting experience. I would have probably found it more impactful if I  hadn’t already read the book   Sapiens   by Yuval Noah Harari. In Pinker’s book,  he introduced some very intriguing ideas; however they were ideas I was  already familiar with thanks to reading   Sapiens . The internal monologue in  my mind was like,   This is interesting. This reminds me of the section in Sapiens  about the cognitive revolution . As a result, while reading   How the Mind Works ,  I would simply write down the keyterm   cognitive revolution   on my bibcard.  I then would create an external reference to the card on cognitive revolution  that was already installed in my Antinet.  30   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory. (New York: Oxford University  Press, 2014), 12.
543 H UMAN   M EMORY   AND   THE   A NTINET     In brief, the internal context in which I read the book was quite different  than what it would have been if I hadn’t read   Sapiens   first. I probably would  have been more impressed with Pinker’s book if that had been the case, too!  When presented with a concept (or a thought) today, the concept activates  related information   internally   in your mind.  For another simple example, imagine you were tasked with memorizing the  following list:   house ,   shoe ,   pig . Let’s hone in on the item   pig . You probably  imagine an abstract representation of a pig (like a pig emoji). I, myself, on  the other hand have a completely different representation of pig. Why?  Because for about a six month period while writing this book, I owned a  pet pig named Garth. When I think of the word   pig , I think of Garth (and  the many times he pissed on my carpet). 31  So what does this mean? In brief, even   prior   to the experiment taking place,  I had a different internal context than you when beginning to memorize the  list. As you can imagine, having certain internal representations could be  quite advantageous for memorizing certain things. 32  A   thought , which is the raw material of an Antinet, is much like an   experience .  As scholars have long recognized, an experience cannot be repeated exactly  on two separate occasions. 33   Every thought is experienced in a somewhat  different context. Context can include   surrounding thoughts   you’ve just had  (and that are   reverberating   in your mind), or the   setting   in which you have  the thought (the   external context ), or the   time   of occurrence. 34  31   Pigs are, let’s just say, “challenging.” Garth would get bored during the day and eat the cov -  ers off my books at home. That’s when I drew the line.  32   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory. (New York: Oxford University  Press, 2014), 249.  33   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory.

544      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Let’s revisit the diagram showing the different variables which shape  a thought:  Every thought is shaped by   internal context . The Antinet captures the   internal  context   of one’s mind quite effectively, and it locks it in time. It does this in  a more effective way than digital systems. I contend this is because digital  systems are always updating themselves. They’re too fluid and they do not  show the internal context of your mind at the time you created a note. For  instance, in one of the cards I was referring to when I wrote this section, there  was a note that explained internal context, and then said, See ‘4214/3 d /3 b /2’.  I have no idea or recollection of making this note, nor did I have any idea  what note 4214/3 d /3 b /2 was. It turned out to be a card about   external context .  Essentially, when I was creating this card about   internal context   I mentioned  something that had to do with   external context   and decided to create a cardlink  to that card (which at the time was something I was closely familiar with).  This communicates to me where my mind was during the time I created the  card. When I created the card about   internal context , my past self wanted to  make sure I differentiated it from   external context   and I provided a link to  external context   in order to view the differences between the two. It stamps  the state of my mind at that time, in a static place in (remembered) time.  With digital notetaking tools, such a note describing a topic would likely be  a bullet point list, and would continually grow, only to be edited, rearranged,  modified, or deleted. By the time I was ready to actually begin writing the
545 H UMAN   M EMORY   AND   THE   A NTINET     section I would no longer see the original internal context and internal life  of that note stamped in time. This is not ideal. You want to see an original  track-record and a snapshot of the original state your mind was in when it  created the note. Granted, I could update the card and add more links later  on; however, to maintain this time connection, I suggest changing ink color  for later additions so that you know it was updated later on.  This may seem like we’re getting into the weeds here; however, it’s something  you’ll come to realize and recognize the benefits of when you work with  your Antinet in practice.  For now, that’s enough on   internal context . To truly understand how the  Antinet locks in   internal context   better than digital systems, you’ll need to  try it out for yourself.  THE PHYSICAL NATURE OF THE ANTINET  ENGENDERS MEMORY PROCESSES NOT  FOUND IN DIGITAL SYSTEMS  The eponymous album by the band   Fleet Foxes   includes a letter written by  lead singer Robin Pecknold that serves as an illustration of the experience  of using an Antinet. Pecknold writes:  My first memory has always been of me and my mom on a cold grey day down  at some beach in Washington, along the Puget Sound somewhere near Seattle.  I would be around two or three years old and we’re with a friend of mine from  the neighborhood and his mom, walking around among the driftwood looking for  crabs. Even now, I can remember the smell and temperature of the air, the feeling  of the sand and the swaying tall grass. I can even remember looking over at my  friend and how his face looked when he smiled back at me. Another memory that  I’ll sometimes recall as my first memory is dressing up in the dead of winter as  Jack London, with tennis rackets on my feet and wearing my dad’s hiking pack,  in the middle of summer after seeing Disney’s (terrible) version of White Fang.  Or there’s the memory of stealing my neighbor’s big wheel and riding it halfway  down the block before getting caught and having to turn around defeated, or of  wearing a fireman’s outfit while washing my parent’s car, or eating an orange  popsicle from the ice cream truck.
546      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  These are and have always been some of my most distinct and persistent memories  of childhood, so it came as a disappointment to me when one day as a teenager,  I opened up a photo album and found pictures of each and every one of those  memories. I didn’t have a single memory that didn’t belong to or somehow grow  from pictures my parents had taken of me when I was growing up. Even the scenes  I remember so clearly in my head are from the same angles as those photographs,  and I don’t really know what to make of it. I’m going to guess that I’d seen all  these photographs at some point, forgotten they were just photographs, and over  time made them into my most tangible memories. That’s scary to me in a way.  This leads me to something weird about the power that music has, it’s transportive  ability.   Any time I hear a song or record that meant a lot to me at a certain  moment or I was listening to at a distinct time, I’m instantly taken back  to that place in full detail.  The phenomenon of feeling like you are “instantly taken back to that place  in full detail” is something that doesn’t just occur with music: it happens  in the Antinet.  After I had spent four years developing “critical thinking” skills in college,  I determined two things: first, it’d be wise for me to record the very best  concepts I learned during my undergraduate studies (so that I could have  them for life). And, second, for some reason I determined the best mecha -  nism for storing the best concepts would be 3 x 5 inch lime green notecards.  Yes, lime green notecards.  Although the bright colors of these lime green notecards render my  thoughts barely legible today, when I happen upon such cards, they’re  amazingly valuable.  You see, the lime green notecards contain not only ideas written on them,  but they transport me back in time. For myself, I’m transported back inside  the room I lived in at the time. The Antinet, with its reliance on notecards,  serves as a powerful mechanism for capturing and reminding one of certain  internal contextual experiences. This derives from the different colors of  notecards you choose to use. It also derives from the different diagrams,
547 H UMAN   M EMORY   AND   THE   A NTINET     drawings and even the style of your handwriting at that point in time. This  is very powerful when it comes time to writing and creating. This experience  leads to potentially insightful breakthroughs that may not otherwise come  about from digital notetaking systems (which possess weaker faculties for  inducing internal contextual memories).  EXTERNAL CONTEXT IN THE ANTINET  Color is an important attribute of human memory. We can observe this from  our own personal experiences (for me, the lime green notecards taking me  back in time). We can find such illustrations of this fact in novels. 35   Or, we  can refer to the field of human memory studies, which lumps this into a  category called   external context . 36  External context refers to the physical environment and physical traits  involved in learning something. This includes location, environment, and  personal perspective. Your perspective derives from your position in the  setting in the memory. External context also includes other parts of your  sensory system—sounds, smells, tastes, textures, and other sensations. 37  External context is an important functional memory input, as recent science  reveals: what one learns in one environment is better recalled later on in  that or a similar environment. 38  In the digital-focused age of today, far too many people overlook the con -  cept of external context, even though this component is critical for building  memory and the mind.  35   Lawrence Block, Hit Man, Reissue edition (HarperTorch, 2002), 280.  36   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory.

548      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  POSITIONAL CODING IN THE ANTINET  Related to the notion that backs up my use of lime green notecards is the  usefulness of notes built using other odd formats. As I’ve previously men -  tioned, in my Antinet I have a notecard about   love   written on an actual leaf  that my fiancé picked out for me. Whenever I come across this note, it cues  the unique external context that generated or embeds the note.  A note such as this inhabits physical space in the Antinet, and also in one’s  mind. The physical location of items that prompt memory is explained in  human memory studies by the notion of   positional coding . In this case, I know  that the position of the leaf notecard is in the middle of the drawer of the  2000 branch of my Antinet. Whenever I wish to navigate to the subject of  love , I simply navigate to that area without having to look up the keyterm   love  in my index. Whenever I’m reading a book, and the concept of   love   appears,  I make a quick observation note of it on my bibcard, and then quickly install  the idea near the leaf notecard in my Antinet.  With the Antinet, positional coding blends with spatial memory to create  spatial encoding. That is, you know where to look for certain pieces of  knowledge based on its spatial position.  Spatial memory is sometimes mentioned in self-help books and programs  that promise to teach one how to develop a super memory. 39   The basic  premise of spatial coding involves assigning particular words (or concepts)  to particular objects in the room you’re currently in. That is, readers are  instructed to imagine “the items arrayed before them on a table or perhaps  imagining themselves learning each item at a different sequential location  along a familiar route.” 40  39   Jim Kwik, Limitless: Upgrade Your Brain, Learn Anything Faster, and Unlock Your  Exceptional Life, Illustrated edition (Carlsbad, California: Hay House Inc., 2020); Kevin  Trudeau, Kevin Trudeau’s Mega Memory (Niles, IL: Nightingale Conant Corp, 1990).  40   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory.

549 H UMAN   M EMORY   AND   THE   A NTINET     The earliest reference to this practice was in 88 BC and is referred to as the  method of loci . People who used this practice include Aristotle, Cicero, and  Quintilian. Cicero referred to it as   artificio memoria . 41   These thinkers assigned  to the thoughts that backed their arguments items situated in rooms and  gardens in order to facilitate their recall. 42  The spatial memory of the   method of loci   operates differently than the spatial  memory of the Antinet. With the Antinet, one isn’t so fixated on assigning  thoughts to objects (such as assigning the thought about   consciousness   to  a plant in the room). That said, properties of spatial memory do indeed  surface when using an Antinet (like me knowing generally where to find  the leaf notecard for   love ).  The reason for this occurring can be traced to “Neurons in the hippocampus  [which] have been shown to be selective to one’s location in space.” 43  The importance of external context and external memory, in which various  objects in our physical environment is not foreign to scholars. 44   This may  be why many are hesitant to discard physically-dependent knowledge sys -  tems that have been actively evolved for over 2,500 years. These important  features are not so easily replaced in the latest switch to using digital tools  to manage our memory externally.  THE EXPLICIT NATURE OF LUHMANN’S  ZETTELKASTEN  It’s important for you to understand these components of the Antinet to gain  a sense for why each individual principle of the Antinet is important.

550      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Antinet was not designed with little thought or care. It very much mirrors  how human brain and memory work. Furthermore, the importance of   context  in the Antinet and how thoughts are developed within contexts (branches)  is another component that should not be overlooked.  With the conclusion of this chapter you now have more than enough the -  oretical understanding of the Antinet’s nature to complement your own  empirical experiments. As usually, the only right answer is to test the system  for yourself, and experience the Antinet’s glory (for yourself)!
551  C H A PT E R T W E N T Y  �  EVOLUTION, PERCEPTION,  PERSPECTIVE AND RUMINANTS  I n this chapter we’ll be   discussing the concept of long-term evolution  in the Antinet. We’ll also be diving into the concepts of perception vs.  perspective, and how the Antinet locks these elements into each notecard.  We’ll cap this chapter off with the concept of the Antinet as a ruminant.  EVOLUTION  In his paper   Communication with Noteboxes , Niklas Luhmann talks about  the “inner life” of the Antinet. He touches upon its “mental history,” which  evolves through time. 45   The inner life and mental history of the Antinet are  brought forth by its unique structure. Specifically, it’s brought forth by the  numeric-alpha addresses. Luhmann refers to the fixed positioning of order  ( Stellordnung ), which is created through unique card addresses. This property  enables the Antinet to evolve over time in such a way that it’s possible to  view the mental history of your thoughts; with the numeric-alpha addresses  and the tree structure, you can observe your mind’s evolution.  Viewing the evolutionary history of your thoughts proves useful for certain  types of activities. Take, for instance, the activity of reading scientific liter -  ature. According to Luhmann, the key to reading scientific texts centers on  long-term memory. According to Luhmann, long-term memory is more  crucial than short-term memory for reading scientific texts because it is  45   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

552      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  necessary to distinguish the “essential from the non-essential and the new  from the merely repetitive.” 46   In other words, you want a system where you  can refresh your memory of your notes and evolve your current ideas with  new ideas. You don’t want to waste time relearning what you already know.  The Antinet’s workflow involves noting down observations on a bibcard.  Then, before actually developing a main note, you review the Antinet. You  figure out   where   a card will be placed before dedicating the time to reformu -  late or reflect on the material. This is an important step as it prevents you  from spending too much time on writing about the   non-essential   or   repetitive  material that you already know.  When you review this material you’re not only reducing the risk of getting  bogged down on things you already know; there’s another useful feature.  As Markus Krajewski observes, “The reader is not only reading his own  memory, but rather also his   shifting frame of reference over time .” 47   In other  words, when you review your Antinet, you’re seeing your shifting frame  of references over time. You’re seeing your different   perspectives   and your  different interpretations of ideas based on communication with different  sources you’ve engaged with. It’s possible to view how your thoughts have  developed, changed, and internally evolved over time.  Oftentimes, the most surprising finds are the links you stamp onto the  cards. These shed light into what the idea reminded you of at the time and  shed light on your own internal reverberation of ideas at a given time. The  cards that these links point to serve as the source material of your own  internal perspectives and context. When viewing Luhmann’s system, this  is something Krajewski confirmed as well: “What is more surprising are  the references listed.” 48  46   Niklas Luhmann, Short Cuts (English Translation) (Frankfurt am Main: Zweitausendeins,  2002), 83.  47   Markus Krajewski,   Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice of a Counter-Measurement  against Forgetting   (Brill, 2016), 331.  48   Krajewski, Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice, 331.
553 E VOLUTION , P ERCEPTION , P ERSPECTIVE   AND   R UMINANTS     This relates to something in human memory called   temporal context . 49   Mem -  ories and thoughts that occur around the same time are essentially   linked  together. 50   Temporal context can be thought of as a function of time, external  context, and internal context. In essence, your thoughts are a function of the  period of time in which you had them. They’re shaped by your own internal  dialogue at that specific time, as well as the external context in which you  have the thought. As a result, you link together a unique set of other ideas at  the time of creation. These unique associations of other ideas are represented  in the form of cardlinks in your Antinet.  These cardlinks are way more valuable and effective than things like   wikilinks  in digital systems. The reason is that notecards in the Antinet are updated  and changed less frequently than in digital systems. Notes in digital systems  are constantly being updated, rearranged, deleted, and added onto. Within  the Antinet, notecards are locked in time once they’re created. This then  locks in a view of the temporal context of your ideas over time.  COMPOUNDING OF IDEAS  Albert Einstein considered   compound interest   to be the eighth wonder of the  world. Warren Buffett has said his financial success is simply “a product of  compound interest.” 51   Simple things compound into complex things. Luh -  mann himself experienced this first hand with his Antinet. The little, simple,  everyday commitment to building and evolving your Antinet results in  genius-level thought. Over time your ideas evolve and snowball into things  you never could have planned. This happens in an organic way, slowly, one  notecard at a time. Thought-by-thought, branch-by-branch, stem-by-stem,  link-by-link, your Antinet evolves into a complex entity, experiencing the  magic of compound interest. Yet it’s not easy. You have to earn it. This is  49   Michael Jacob Kahana,   Foundations of Human Memory . (New York: Oxford University  Press, 2014), 14.  50   Mostafa M. El-Kalliny et al., “Changing Temporal Context in Human Temporal Lobe  Promotes Memory of Distinct Episodes,”   Nature Communications   10, no. 1 ( January 14,  2019): 203.  51   “Compoundingquotes,” Investment Masters Class, accessed July 18, 2021, http://masters -  invest.com/compounding.
554      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  often seen as a negative aspect of the Antinet (writing things by hand is  hard); yet it pays off in the end.  Markus Krajewski observes, “Whoever sets about ongoing work (or com -  munication) with such a secondary memory can not only count on the  fact that the apparatus will faithfully reproduce everything which has been  shared with it, they can also trust that, with the information successively  provided over time, future knowledge will be enriched.” 52   In essence, the  individual notes you provide to the Antinet will be enriched over time. The  individual pieces of information compound and collide with one another  to form rich pathways of knowledge. When it comes time to write, your  cognitive energy is freed up to collaborate with this entity. You’re left with a  very rich, interconnected store of knowledge with which you can creatively  reinterpret that knowledge and tie it into the paper or creative work you’re  actively building.  The idea of notes becoming a rich store of value is certainly not a new one.  John Aubrey (1626–1697), a fellow of the Royal Society, once said that  habitual notetaking creates “‘nest eggs’ for the future.” 53  The bottom line is this: The entity you’re creating with the Antinet is a  complex one. It’s a product of compounding the interest of your ideas. The  result is something magical: it morphs into an entity that you (and only  you) can truly understand.  PERCEPTION AND PERSPECTIVE  Perception   and   perspective   derive from similar etymological roots. These  terms are often confused with one another, even though they’re different.  Perception comes from the Latin term   percipere . Let’s break this apart.   Per  means “fully.”   Cipere   means “to grasp” or “to take.” Combined,   percipere  means to fully grasp, understand or interpret the meaning of something.  52   Markus Krajewski,   Note-Keeping: History, Theory, Practice , 326.  53   Richard Yeo,   Notebooks, Recollection, and External Memory: Some Early Modern English  Ideas and Practices   (Brill, 2016), 138.
555 E VOLUTION , P ERCEPTION , P ERSPECTIVE   AND   R UMINANTS     Perspective comes from the Latin term   perspecere .   Per   means the same thing  as it does in   percipere   (“fully”).   Specere   means “to observe” or “to spectate.”  Combined,   perspecere   means to fully observe and to see and spectate.  Think of perception as applying your own   interpretation   of some observations.  Perception uses   interpretation   to help us derive   meaning   out of an observation.  The meaning you assign to an observation shapes your thoughts, which  shape your reality.  Think of perspective as your   point of view . Perspective is your vantage point.  It’s a function of space and time. Where you are in the world, and at what  time you observe an event shapes your perspective.  When you use an Antinet your notes contain both your perspective and your  perceptions of ideas. When you create reformulation notes, you’re summariz -  ing ideas based on your perspective at the time. You’re shaping your ideas by  your current point of view. When you create reflection notes, you’re adding  your own   interpretations   of the ideas you encounter. You’re stamping your
556      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  own perceptions of ideas onto your notes. These are locked in time. They  are not updated, overwritten or edited (like they often are in digital tools).  It’s very important that both your perspectives and perceptions be locked  in time. This provides the raw material for the communication experience  that makes the Antinet so valuable. When you go back and review old notes,  you’re having a communication experience. You’re viewing ideas containing  your second mind’s perspectives and perceptions. You’re then comparing  these with your own present-day perspectives and perceptions. This creates  the valuable internal dialogue we’ve touched upon throughout this book.  You begin seeing your perspectives and perceptions   evolve   over time. This  proves to be an invaluable interaction during the creation process.  RUMINANTS  Ruminants are a type of mammal that acquire nutrients from eating grass.  They first ferment the grass in a specialized stomach called a   rumen . After  the grass is fermented in the rumen, it is then digested.  The word ruminant comes from the Latin term   ruminare , which means “to  chew slowly.” This is where the term   rumination   derives from.
557 E VOLUTION , P ERCEPTION , P ERSPECTIVE   AND   R UMINANTS     Here’s why I’m even talking about this: in Luhmann’s own Zettelkasten,  he describes his system by calling it a   ruminant .  “ The Zettelkasten is like the complicated digestive system of a  ruminant. All arbitrary ideas, all coincidences of reading, can be  included. It is then the internal connectivity that decides .”  –Niklas Luhmann, Zettelkasten II: 9/8i 54  By calling it a ruminant, Luhmann is referring to the idea that some pieces  of knowledge need time to be digested. The technique of using external  references (ExRefs) helps with this. Sometimes you come across interesting  material; however you don’t yet know whether the idea is worth fully pro -  cessing yet. In this case you create ExRefs for the material and thus enable  the material to ruminate in the Antinet. If the time comes wherein the  material will become useful, you can then digest the material by converting  it into a main note. Or, you can digest the material by using it while writing  your manuscript.  The idea of the mind as a ruminant is not a new concept. The French Catholic  philosopher Antonin Sertillanges writes:  Man’s mind is a ruminant. The cow looks away into the dis -  tance, chews slowly, bites off here a tuft and there a twig,  takes the whole field for her own, and the horizon as well,  producing her milk from the field, feeding her dim soul on  the horizon. 55  What this involves is   reverberation   as understood in the study of human  memory. I talk about the concept of reverberation throughout this text.  54   “ZK II: Zettel 9/8i—Niklas Luhmann-Archiv,” accessed May 4, 2022,   https://niklas-luh -  mann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_NB_9-8i_V .  55   OP A.

558      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The idea involves “just-experienced” ideas and associations reverberating  in one’s mind. 56   Reverberation is most often associated with short-term  memory. However, with the Antinet, you can lock in reverberation over a  longer period of time. Reverberation over the long term reflects the concept  of rumination.  The idea of rumination doesn’t just have important implications in the  Antinet. Rather the way you approach books involves rumination as well.  As Francis Bacon once pointed out, “Some books are to be tasted, others  to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.” 57   Some books  are to be read only in parts; others should be skimmed, some few should be  read wholly, and others should be read with deliberate attention. Mortimer  Adler asserted: “Reading a book analytically is chewing and digesting it.” 58  Yet without the Antinet, the knowledge one gains during analytical reading  is lost. The Antinet captures the insights from deep analytical reading and  stores them for the long term. In the Antinet these deep insights collide  with other ideas and compound.  The point in all of this is reflected in the following suggestion: view the  Antinet as a   ruminant of your mind . Store all of your material there that you  wish to evolve. Store both your fully developed thoughts, as well as thoughts  that need more time to sprout.  56   Kahana,   Foundations of Human Memory , 9.  57   Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren,   How to Read a Book , revised and updated  edition (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), 19.  58   Adler and Van Doren,   How to Read a Book , 19.
559  C H A PT E R T W E N T Y- O N E  �  RANDOMNESS, SURPRISES  AND ACCIDENTS  A s we’ve learned ,   one of   the more overlooked benefits of the Antinet is  its ability to foster randomness, thanks to its tree structure. This struc -  ture generates invaluable surprises and accidents, allowing users to encounter  ideas they would otherwise not have reviewed had they been using digital  systems. When you work with an analog system, you’re exploring and sifting  through your previous thoughts. This ignites a reverberation of ideas that  circulate in your mind, causing a crucial “collision” of ideas in your mind  during the writing process.  RANDOMNESS  Here, randomness is a feature, not a bug. A key property of a living, evolving,  anti-fragile system is its unorthodox structure. The perfectly normalized  structures we find in digital notetaking systems are synthetic. They’re frag -  ile. They’re overly malleable and they rarely retain a unique character. As  one scholar points out, “Evolution always occurs through the selection of  accidental differences without a design.” 1  It doesn’t seem intuitive, but here’s the reality: randomness doesn’t come  from chaos alone. Randomness actually relies on order. As Luhmann states,  “even the creation of random suggestions requires organization.” 2  1   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 11.  2   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans. Manfred
560      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  When I first began using notecards to store my thoughts in 2006, I would  simply take notes about a book on 3 x 5 inch cards. Each card contained  one idea. These notes were primarily   reformulation notes . They summarized  individual concepts I learned while reading the book. By the time I finished  reading the book, I would have about twenty or thirty new 3 x 5 inch cards.  I would then wrap a rubber band around them and throw them in a shoebox.  From time to time I would then review the notecards.  However, this isn’t the most   ordered   structure. It’s seemingly random. The  Antinet, on the other hand, introduces an ordered structure (numeric-alpha  addresses and the tree-like branching architecture). As a paradoxical result,  the structure induces more useful random features.  SURPRISES  The tree structure of the Antinet encourages the asking of unique questions  that are less commonly asked when one uses digital systems, since those  systems are fully indexed with full text search. Upon encountering a new  idea while using an Antinet, you ask yourself questions like   What is the  name of that concept . You’re then prompted to ask what other terms live  near that concept if you can’t find its location. It requires finding alternative  ways to think about the concept and to essentially re-imprint the pathways  that led you to the idea. This practice is a fun way to approach knowledge.  Embarking upon an associative-thinking process brings about fascinating  surprises along the way. Your current mind (with its own active memory)  has a dialogue with your past self (your second mind), and this dialogue  often results in amazing surprises. If nothing else, the core output of the  Antinet is one thing: it’s a “surprise generator.” 3  Kuehn, https://daily.scottscheper.com/zettelkasten/.  3   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution  in Early Modern Europe 53 (2016), 295.
561 R ANDOMNESS , S URPRISESAND   A CCIDENTS     As one scholar observes of Luhmann’s system: “a true communication  process is triggered that exploits the machine’s ability to   surprise , i.e., to  produce information.” 4  The same scholar observes how a true secondary memory arises when the  questions one asks triggers a network of associative references and links.  These links then give birth to “collaborative” reasoning   that was not inten -  tionally designed . 5   The network of associative references refers both to the  concept of   forward associations   and to   remote associations . Here we see that  the tree structure, with the continuous flow of cards as well as the remote  cardlinks, helps create a   collaborative   communication relationship with the  second mind. It also serves as the core component for creating surprises  (realizations that are a result that   had not been intentionally designed ).  Again, the network structure of the Antinet is similar to   associationism . 6   The  association of nodes in the network is based on contiguity. The continuous  flow of notes (containing thoughts) is augmented by insertions of similar  material later on. Thoughts grow contiguously from previous branches and  are grouped together with similar thoughts over time. These two components  ( contiguity   and   similarity ) are the very components which govern thought  in general, and that is used to the Antinet’s advantage.  THE NATURE OF SURPRISES  Isaac Asimov once observed that great ideas and breakthroughs begin not  with   Eureka!   but with   Hmm ,   that ’ s funny. 7   While using the Antinet, you’ll  come across many instances where you think to yourself   Hmm ,   that ’ s funny!  Take note of these instances and create links between them.  4   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 15.  Emphasis added.  5   Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early  Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden   ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 20.  6   Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works, Norton pbk (New York: Norton, 2009), 113.  7   Adam Grant, Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know (New York, New  York: Viking, 2021), 59.
562      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Keep in mind, though, that in the spirit of good science, you should not let  your guard down. When you say to yourself,   that’s funny , that doesn’t mean  the idea is true. It could merely mean that the idea is interesting. Ideas have  a tendency to survive not necessarily because they’re true, but because  they’re interesting. 8   In the name of good science, you ought to search for  surprises that excavate   truth . Your goal should not center on excavating stuff  that’s merely interesting—that’s pop science gibberish.  In some ways, the Antinet helps mitigate against getting carried away by  interesting but unfounded insights. It does this by collecting   contradictions .  Surrounding the leaves and stems of cards that generate surprises it’s likely  that one will find thoughts that contradict the surprise. This is only possible  thanks to the principle of not erasing anything in your Antinet. The fact that  contradictory ideas remain for you to find helps you filter out ideas which are  merely interesting in order to find insights that are both interesting   and   true.  In addition to this anti-self-deception mechanism, the fact that you’re  neuroimprinting ideas enables you to call to mind the contradictory ideas  by attending to the reverberation achieved through writing by hand and  sifting through your notes. In brief, you’re less likely to deceive yourself  when working with the Antinet. Why? Because you can think of examples  that contradict insights you might otherwise be charmed by.  THE ANTINET IS BUILT FOR SURPRISES  Thanks to the Antinet’s structure, surprises are achieved by giving the Antinet  “autonomy.” 9   This autonomy is created by the commitment to never change  card addresses. Unlike digital files with their dynamically updating links, the  Antinet’s card addresses never change. Likewise, aside from editing marks  or additions made directly on a card (that leave a trace of the change in  8   Adam Grant, Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know (New York, New  York: Viking, 2021), 59.  9   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines. Knowledge Management Evolution  in Early Modern Europe 53 (2016), 295.
563 R ANDOMNESS , S URPRISESAND   A CCIDENTS     thinking), any future changes made to the information on a card can only  occur by adding related, child-like nodes underneath it.  The commitment to never change card addresses is pretty easy and doesn’t  require willpower (unlike the temptation to change card addresses in a dig -  ital system). Thanks to the analog nature of the Antinet, it’s just completely  impractical to change the addresses of many cards!  This is a good thing. If constant changing, deleting, or updating of the  system were possible, it would rip out the unique personality of that sys -  tem. Because of this, complementary and contradictory thoughts are  gathered in an essentially “locked” system that then generates surprise com -  binations.  AN EXAMPLE OF A SURPRISE  Something interesting happened a few months into building out my Antinet.  I was going through the process of installing my legacy notecards when  I came upon a card pertaining to something called   cluster analysis . In machine  learning, cluster analysis involves using algorithms to classify data patterns  into groups or clusters. The clusters are then analyzed to determine which  features and properties make the groups alike.  When I went to create a keyterm for   cluster analysis   I was surprised by the fact  that I already had a keyterm for the term   cluster ! What I found was that the  keyterm linked to something in the cognitive biases branch of my Antinet  (address 2431/18). When I traveled to that card, I found a concept outlining  something called   clustering illusion . Suddenly I recalled this concept that  refers to a cognitive fallacy by which humans see patterns in data—even  if the data is completely random. This tendency usually happens when the  data is composed of a small random sample.  As a result of this, in my section for cluster analysis, I included a disclaimer  for my future self:   Before beginning any significant time investment in cluster  analysis, be wary of falling into the trap of clustering illusion   ( See   ‘ 2431 / 18 ’).  In brief, I’ve created a link across two branches of knowledge that have very  important implications for each other.
564      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  These types of surprises occur frequently in the Antinet because the keyterms  and links are created deliberately. When you see a surprising occurrence (like  the shared term   cluster   which points to concepts which may contradict each  other), you pay closer attention to them. You appreciate the surprise more  and you use the surprise by creating relevant links between the two ideas.  If I were using a digital system, I believe it would have been less likely that I’d  have realized the same relationship between the two ideas. If I had searched  the term   cluster , I’d likely have found myself bombarded with dozens, if not  hundreds, of notes containing the term   cluster .

I would  have quickly passed over the commonality of these two concepts because  they would have been crowded out by too much information.  HETEROGENOUS RELATIONS  Luhmann points out that the most fruitful types of surprises within the  Antinet happen by way of relating “heterogeneous things with each other.”  He holds that it’s more valuable to associate patterns between ideas that  otherwise would not be associated with one another. 10  One interesting way to facilitate these   heterogenous relations   is to group ideas  around certain   polarizing   keyterms.  For instance, in my index I’ve created the keyterm   Most , and some interesting  concepts have grown around it.  For example, there’s the idea stemming from life philosophy:   Most   Important  Variable for Success in Life . This keyterm entry points me to card 2460/2/0,  which contains an idea from the book   How to Get Rich   by Felix Dennis. The  idea centers on the concept that   self-belief   is the most important variable  for success in life and suggests that we lack self-belief because we do not  10   Niklas Luhmann, “Communication with Noteboxes (Revised Edition),” trans.

One way to develop this confidence is to retrain your  mind through the use of self-affirmations, a (positive) form of self-deception.  Now, when I navigate to another keyterm relating to   Most , I find the follow -  ing entry:   Most Important Variable for Success in Science . Cardlink 2431/1/1  points out that avoiding   self-deception   is the key to success in science. Rich -  ard Feynman points out that, “The first principle is that you must not fool  yourself, and you’re the easiest person to fool.”  It seems we have an interesting paradox here. The key to success in life is  self-belief , which may involve self-deception. Yet the key to success in science  is avoiding   self-deception . This creates an opportunity to explore this con -  flict in greater detail to determine how one can cultivate healthy self-belief,  without falling prey to the downsides of self-deception.  This is just one example of how heterogenous relations can emerge around  certain keyterms in an Antinet.  Heterogenous Relations by Way of Proximity  Another example of heterogenous relations happens naturally thanks to the  tree structure of the Antinet.  As you’ve learned,   associations   are a fundamental building block of human  memory. Yet, rather than liken associations to simply links between related  items, associations have an additional function: they create new entities alto -  gether. Some types of associations collide and create new ideas. In human  memory studies this is called a   holistic association . 11   For example, take the  following sequence of items:   horse   and   house . When one thinks of those  items together, they may think of a new entity altogether: a   barn . Essentially  the proximity of those two items creates a new holistic entity.  Luhmann would regard these associations as fruitful instances of surprise  and accident. They are the result of seemingly heterogenous ideas forming  11   Michael Jacob Kahana, Foundations of Human Memory. (New York: Oxford  University Press, 2014), 12.
566      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  around a certain area that, when viewed together as a   whole , create a new  entity altogether. Ultimately, these heterogenous relations create a new form  of understanding that otherwise would not have existed.  Bisociation  Recall that Luhmann devised the Antinet because, in his words, he “wanted  to accumulate knowledge and open up a   combination of possibilities .” 12   Thus,  using heterogenous relations to effect bisociation—which refers to the simul -  taneous mental association of an idea or object across two fields that are not  normally regarded as related—Luhmann did in fact create combinations of  possibilities. 13   Furthermore, he did this by first reducing the complexity of  books he read by extracting irresistible material. He then added back com -  plexity by way of bisociating the material using links. “In a way,” Luhmann  said, “the [Antinet Zettelkasten] is a reduction to build complexity.” 14  In brief the Antinet is one big network which enables one to create biso -  ciations by way of linking ideas across different branches of knowledge.  As you’ve seen, this is something that can happen in several ways using an  Antinet, at the core of which is randomness, surprise, and accidents.  ACCIDENTS  Like randomness, accidents are a feature, not a bug. Accidents play a most  crucial part in advancing the evolution of organisms. Likewise, they play a  most crucial part in advancing thinking. Luhmann understood this as well.  “The role of accidents,” he wrote, “in the theory of science is not disputed. If  you employ evolutionary models, accidents assume a most important role.” 15  12   Niklas Luhmann, Niklas Luhmann Short Cuts (English Translation), 2002, 22.

567 R ANDOMNESS , S URPRISESAND   A CCIDENTS     How does one unleash the power of accidents? First, you must understand  what is meant by the term   accident . We’re not trying to create   needless   acci -  dents. We’re trying to create   useful   accidents. Useful accidents are those  which are usually   surprising   in nature. In the section on surprises we explored  the types of accidents that are useful. Accidents that involve interesting  heterogenous relations and fascinating bisociations are the accidents we’re  aiming for with the Antinet.  One way the Antinet generates the accidents we’re looking for comes from  its analog nature: when surfing through the Antinet and shuffling through  cards, one increases the probability of useful accidents.  Some of the best advice from scholars and researchers focuses on this  act. While doing online research is faster, it misses out on the serendipity  of physical exploration. An excellent library encompasses such features.  It possesses journals, books, and librarians who are shockingly helpful and  more knowledgeable than we give them credit for. Accidents emerge from  “prowling the stacks” of books related to the field you’re interested in. 16  The power of   prowling the stacks   of books also applies to notecards. The  power of sifting through notecards, and in turn, yielding fruitful accidents,  is something scholars have known for quite some time. This powerful fea -  ture of card indexes first became recognized by scholars in the seventeenth  and eighteenth centuries. Scholars noted that Antinet systems, with their  structural decoupling of knowledge into individual notecards, ends up pro -  ducing “a substantial number of combinations and insights that otherwise  might not have existed.” 17  Kuehn, https://daily.scottscheper.com/zettelkasten/.  16   Kate L.

568      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  MOVEMENT OVER MEDITATION  “ I do not believe in coincidence. I believe that if you  keep moving, you expose yourself to a better chance of  accidents happening, some good and some bad .”  –Travis McGee, in   A Purple Place for Dying 18  Accidents don’t come solely from the unique tree structure of the Antinet,  however. One other thing is required: movement.  One of my mentors, Sir Gary Halbert, preached   movement over meditation .  In essence, the more you move, the more success you have. The more you  create and learn from mistakes, the luckier you’ll get. Luhmann himself  was tirelessly curious. He kept moving, kept reading, and kept uncovering  useful accidents.  This flies in the face of the conventional and popular wisdom today. The  advice we hear centers on meditating and sitting under a tree. The advice  we hear is that   stillness is key . Yet on the other end of the spectrum (literally)  we have people moving constantly. They’re the ones who are going to put  the human race on Mars.  Of course, it’s a balancing act (like everything). However, if you want to  create useful accidents with your Antinet, you need to keep moving. You  need to keep creating and learning.  Even if the knowledge you create isn’t useful immediately, there’s a good  chance it will be useful later on. During the writing of this book, I’ve used  material and notecards written from many years ago. I had no idea they  would be used for a project when I created them. It’s something you’ll  experience as well.  18   John D.

569 R ANDOMNESS , S URPRISESAND   A CCIDENTS     When Luhmann was working on a new publication he would document  and record how his thought process evolved. 19   He would take on publi -  cation requests and work on articles that would later prove very useful in  other areas. Over the course of producing these developments, Luhmann’s  theories compounded and evolved. By moving, he created more material  which proved useful for other areas of his work. His movement to constantly  take on publication projects allowed him to create useful accidents which  compounded his actions. It created the rich material that would form his  “super theory” of society.  While accidents, and randomness are the key components we’re speaking of,  the question then becomes: in what spirit of mind does one best cultivate  useful accidents? That question is what we’ll answer next.  PLAYFULNESS, CURIOSITY,  AND TINKERING  Halfway through the month of June in 1749, all of Britain was buzzing with  excitement. Things were especially abuzz in Surrey County, which borders  London. The excitement revolved around one thing: a matchup between  two of Britain’s cricket clubs, the All England and the Surrey Cricket Clubs.  The cricket teams were viewed as the titans of those times. “The match  excited considerable interest and was attended by a very numerous body  of spectators,” wrote one who attended. 20  The match between the two clubs was intense. The score was close; however  in a wild upset victory, Surrey came away with the win. The best player  in the match, Henry Venn, was exhausted. The other players on the team  looked up to Henry. He was bold, disciplined, resolute, passionate, and very  (very) intense.  19   Johannes Schmidt, “Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index: Thinking Tool, Communication  Partner, Publication Machine,” Forgetting Machines.

570      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  After Surrey came away with the victory Henry’s teammates crowded around  him. They gathered to celebrate the upset victory. Yet the excitement came  to a stop and things quickly settled down. The fans stopped celebrating and  fell quiet.  Everyone was looking at Henry whose face was red, as if he was angry.  He threw down his bat and declared, “ Whoever wants a bat, then here! Take it.  I have no further occasion for it! ” 21  His teammates were shocked. Their hero was quitting on the spot! One of  his teammates bravely asked Henry why he was quitting, and Henry replied,  “Because I am to be ordained on Sunday.” Henry explained he was quitting  the game of cricket for God. He feared a member of his church remarking  to him, “Nice game yesterday, Reverend!”  Henry intended to be a man who was taken seriously. To his mind this  meant he must take life seriously, and this meant one thing: cutting out all  forms of play.  Sadly, what followed was all but fulfillment and respect for Henry. His health  quickly declined by “a sudden transition from a course of most violent  exercise to a life of comparative inactivity.” 22   Yet Henry pushed through the  health issues and stuck with a strict regimen. He would wake up at five in  the morning and preach ceaselessly all day. This continued on until he had  a breakdown at age forty-nine. Henry burnt himself out and was relegated  to a small country parish where he lived for another twenty six years.  Two generations of protestant missionaries followed in their forebear’s foot -  steps. Both his son ( John) and his grandson (also named Henry) became  Anglican clergymen.  21   John   Venn,   Annals   of   a   Clerical   Family:   Being   Some   Account   of   the   Family   and   Descendants  of William Venn, Vicar of Otterton, Devon, 1600-1621 (Macmillan and Company, 1904), 71.  22   John   Venn,   Annals   of   a   Clerical   Family:   Being   Some   Account   of   the   Family   and   Descendants  of William Venn, Vicar of Otterton, Devon, 1600-1621 (Macmillan and Company, 1904), 71.
571 R ANDOMNESS , S URPRISESAND   A CCIDENTS     Yet Henry’s physical and mental breakdown hung over the family. It was  an unspoken yet very present tension, a tension between work for God vs.  play (in the form of cricket).  This tension was present during the upbringing of Henry Venn’s great grand -  son, John Venn.  John was a bright young man. Despite his strict Anglican upbringing,  he became interested in mathematics and philosophy. In spite of his interests,  John gave in to the religious indoctrination and ended up following in his  family’s footsteps, becoming ordained as an Anglican priest in 1859.  Unlike his great grandfather, however, John didn’t wish to give up his other  interests in his life. He loved cricket and outdoor activities like mountain  climbing and he did not want to give his interest up as had his great grand -  father. 23   Instead of giving up his interests in mathematics and philosophy,  John continued his studies, and, in 1883, he resigned from the clergy after  concluding that his religion was incompatible with his philosophical beliefs.  John continued to pursue life with a playful spirit. His passions ranged from  mathematics, probability theory, and philosophy, to tinkering with inventions  and machinery. He would go on to create the first cricket machine in history.  It bowled cricket balls and is said to have struck out the leading batsman of  the Australian cricket club four times in a row. 24  Now, the reason you probably know John Venn stems from the following  diagram (see following page):  23   Patrick J. Hurley and Lori Watson, A Concise Introduction to Logic (Cengage Learning,  2016), 284.  24   “John Venn | Biography, Inventions and Facts,” accessed May 3, 2022, https://www.famous  inventors.org/john-venn.
572      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  The Venn Diagram  All of John Venn’s wide-ranging interests ironically led him to create a diagram  in symbolic logic. This diagram is widely used and bears his name to this day.  This breakthrough in symbolic logic was not unearthed in the same man -  ner John’s great grandfather operated. It was not unearthed through rigid  routine and workaholism. John was playful in spirit, he was a tinkerer, and  he was curious.  Those who love order and structure may at first have trouble adopting  the philosophy of the Antinet. In the land of binary, the world is perfectly  ordered. This (0), or not this (1) underlies the language of digital systems.  Binary logic makes life quite simple. But that’s not reality. There’s entropy  and chaos in reality.

You must be willing to submit  to the mess of knowledge development, and to adopt and appreciate the  value of randomness, embracing odd structures and surprises along the way.  It involves adopting a playful mindset when working with your knowledge.  Hopefully this story about John Venn will remind you of this.  To make sure I don’t forget the lesson of John Venn, I purchased a cricket  ball online which I keep in my office. Whenever I see it, I’m reminded to  adopt the playful tinkering mindset of John Venn. This is the spirit I believe  best suited for working with an Antinet. A playful, curious spirit.  In my YouTube videos I teach the Antinet from my office. Using my iPhone  camera, I navigate around and teach certain aspects. Some viewers have  commented, asking why there’s a cricket ball sitting around. Now you know  why. It’s a great reminder. Adopting playfulness, randomness, and curiosity  into your knowledge workflow is something one should not forget.  Now, as we end this book, I’d like to invite you to adopt this same spirit. Take  it with you into the world. The spirit of playfulness, randomness, and curiosity.  I had no idea I’d be ending this book with this seemingly random story of  John Venn. His story relates to the playful intellectual human spirit. This is  but another example of randomness and accidents being brought forth by  the Antinet. Quite frankly, it serves as a fitting end for such a book.  I wish you enjoyment in your journey. The journey of getting in touch with  that deep, internal voice inside of you.

575  AFTERWORD  What you have read in   this book contains both everything and nothing  you need to know about building an Antinet Zettelkasten. That’s how you  know the material is true. I believe the most   truthful   knowledge resembles  that of a paradox. It simultaneously tells you everything and nothing about  the nature of something. It’s kinda like learning about Einstein’s theory of  relativity. It tells you everything and nothing about how the universe works.  It just is what it is.  What I’ve laid forth in this book is the theory, practice, and history of working  with the Antinet. I’ve also done my best to describe the more metaphysical  features of the system—the Antinet as a communication partner and second  mind. Interspersed between this is the science of human memory and the  science of knowledge.  However, in the end, the only right answer is: test.  To experience the power of the Antinet, you must experiment with it your -  self. You must commit to it. You must invest in it. Commit yourself to the
576      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  work. Commit yourself to the time and the energy required to build your  own second mind.  I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this book. I’ve had a wonderful time creating  it. Stewie and I have been through a lot together in the year we spent writing  it. We’ve been through several lives together. We have seen our personali -  ties change drastically throughout the process. We’ve been through many  rearrangements of my office here in downtown San Diego. We’ve been  through many different arrangements of my Antinet. During the writing of  this book I’ve gone from a single dude with one cat (Brodus); to a single  dude with two cats (Brodus and Fiona); to an engaged dude with two cats,  a soul-daughter, and a pig (Garth); to an engaged dude with two cats and  a soul-daughter (sorry, Garth). Throughout all phases of this journey, one  thing has been the same, actually two: first, I’ve continued to be a badass  (in my own mind), and second, Stewie has been by my side.  I hope you get to enjoy the fullness of creating and evolving your own thoughts  using an Antinet.

583  APPENDIX C: DIGITAL ANTINETS  Sometimes people contact me   and write   Scott, thank you! I finally under -  stand how the Zettelkasten is supposed to work!   These reactions are typically  found in the YouTube comments on my videos. Yet every so often I get people  who follow up this praise with some excuse. They insist analog won’t work  for them. For instance, they complain about their bad handwriting. Or they  object to keeping a notebox due to their work environment. 1   Naturally, they  follow this up with the question of   How can I implement the Antinet digitally ?  In brief: you can’t.  Well, you can’t without sacrificing various benefits, that is.  But…  If you put a gun to my head and told me to build a digital Antinet, here’s  what I would do:  First, I wouldn’t do it.  Now with that out of the way, we can move on to the second thing I’d do.  The second thing I would do would be to add a character limit to notes. I did  a rough count of the character space on 4 x 6 inch notecards (or the equiva -  lent,   a 6 paper). I estimate the character space to be roughly 825 characters.  Here’s one of my notecards, word-for-word:  1   I address these objections in the chapter on Analog.
584      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  When you strip away “contiguity” in the system, thus leaving  a pile of leaves, you dismantle the mind of the system. You  destroy the system’s memory and its unique way in under -  standing things. You’ve turned your communication partner  into a pile of leaves! See: ‘4212/2 b 5’  “Shared meaning” of items that are also located nearby one  another (forward associations, backward associations, and  nearby associations) “play a crucial role in the function of  human memory,” according to one scholar who specializes  in the field.  In other words, note the important distinction: it’s the stem -  links & branchlinks which play a crucial role in how human  memory works—not just remote links. Digital Zettelkastens  do not possess the first two.  (Kahana, 11)  Here’s a photo of it:

Denn etwas kann nur erkannt werden durch Hinweis  auf ein anderes, das wiederum in weiteren Zusammenhän -  gen bedeutsam ist. Und das Gewicht, das die Feststellung  von etwas als etwas hat, empfängt sie von diesen anderen  Zusammenhängen her, auf die sie verweist.

586      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Again, there’s some white space in both of these cards. Plus, I’m not count -  ing the card addresses. For these reasons, I think a character limit of 825 is  a good guesstimate.  If I were forced to build a digital Antinet, the third thing I’d do is this:  I’d disable editing and deleting. Once a note is created it should not be edited  or deleted. Yet, appending other ideas onto the note is fine. Such additions  can be in the form of adding text to any blank space. For example, adding  ‘See Also’-cardlinks . This would be like a pop-up bubble seen when hovering  your mouse over an image. For instance, there are design collaboration  apps that allow designers to add pop-out text over areas of the design as a  comment bubble over the image.  The fourth thing I’d do if forced to build a digital Antinet relates to the direc -  tory structure. There would be three top level structures, corresponding to  the three boxes of an Antinet: (1) Bibliography Box, (2) Index Box, and (3)  Main Box). It would be look like this:  –   Bib  *   Adams, Scott— God’s Debris  *   Adler, Mortimer— How to Read a Book  *   Ahrens, Sönke— How to Take Smart Notes  *   …  *   Zlotnik, Gregorio— Memory: An Extended Definition  –   Index  *   bstraction  *   Abundance  *   Accounting  *   …  *   Zone of Genius  –   Main  *   1000  *   1100  *   1100.1  *   1100.1.1  *   1100.1.1 a
587 A PPENDIX   C: D IGITAL   A NTINETS     *   1100.1.2  *   …  *   5999  The fifth thing I would do if forced to build a digital Antinet would be to  eliminate the ability to copy and paste.  The sixth thing I would do would be to delete tags and backlinks from  the system.  The seventh thing I would do is delete the search box. This forces users to  deliberately create keyterms in the index. It also forces one to navigate the  Antinet in a more exploratory way.  The final thing I would do would be to delete the whole digital repository  and get back to creating knowledge the analog way!  Ironically, one of the individuals who, early on, claimed analog wasn’t an  option for them ended up changing their stance. They tried building out the  Antinet the right way (the analog way), and they’ve since come to see the light.  I believe the majority of those who claim that analog isn’t for them simply  possess false beliefs. If they would only test it first themselves, they’d come  to realize the advantages of analog.  Still, everyone’s different. I’m not some analog luddite. Try both for yourself.  If you decide analog doesn’t do it for you, then hopefully the guidelines I’ve  laid forth in this section will be of service to you.  Oh, and one last thing: don’t do digital.

589  GLOSSARY  Analog Knowledge Development (“AKD”) : A term for those who   develop  knowledge using analog tools. Knowledge development refers to four phases:  (1)   selecting   sources of knowledge and the material within those sources;  (2)   extracting   interesting thoughts from books, podcasts, videos, and other  media; (3)   creating   notes that elaborate on the thoughts one extracts from  knowledge sources; (4)   installing   those thoughts into a long-term storage  structure so that the thoughts may evolve (the Antinet Zettelkasten being  the ultimate storage structure).  Antinet : A notebox containing four core properties (or principles): Analog,  Numeric-Alpha Card Addresses, a Tree Structure, and an Index. Together,  these four principles create a cybernetic thinking network.   Variant terms:  Antinet Zettelkasten, Analog Zettelkasten, Luhmannian Zettelkasten .  Antinetter : Those who develop knowledge using the Antinet. These are  the crazy ones, the crazy few. Those who know, deep-down, that developing  their thoughts using analog tools (and specifically the Antinet Zettelkasten)  is the most magical, powerful, intimate way of creating meaningful output.  Bibliography Box (“Bib Box”) : A box in the Antinet which stores all of  your bibcards (notes from the books you read). These bibcards are stored  alphabetically by author’s last name.  Bibliography Card (“Bibcard”) : A 4 x 6 inch notecard oriented vertically.  This card is used to store observational thoughts with a corresponding page  number while reading (or engaging with other sources like podcasts, vid -  eos, lectures, etc.). Also useful as a bookmark.   Variant terms: Staging Card,  Literature Notes .
590      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Bibliography Notes (“Bib Notes”) : These are short, observational notes  from readings (or other media), which are placed on bibcards. They begin  with a page number, and then a very brief observation or thought. The bib  notes are then transformed into more in-depth notes (called main notes).  Bubble Graph Boiz : Digitally-obsessed PKM individuals who spend their  days majoring in the minor. These folks obsess over metadata tags, and  creating interesting templates for creating notes. The one thing they do  not prioritize is knowledge development. Nor do they prioritize output.  You can find these individuals hanging out in your favorite PKM software’s  forums.   Variant terms: Workflow Warriors, Digital notetaking Junkies, Hotkey  Addicts, Plugin Perverts .  Card Address : The numeric-alpha notecard address affixed to the top-left  or top-right of each notecard (e.g., 4214/5a/1).  Cardlink : Within a notecard, when you reference another card address in  your Antinet, you’re effectively creating a cardlink. For instance, when you  find the following card address placed within the main area of a notecard  (not in the top-left or top-right), you’re creating a cardlink (e.g., 4214/14).  Cardlinks aren’t like digital links. They’re hard to create. Cardlinks are  hardlinks (this is a good thing)!  Collectives : A notecard with a list of keyterms, phrases or cardlinks to  other cards in the Antinet.   Variant terms: Hubs, Hub Notes, Structured Notes,  Maps of Content .  External References (ExRefs) : References to external sources outside of  the Antinet. For instance, a reference to a specific book and page number  ( Scheper, Scott. Antinet Zettelkasten, p. 122 ).   Variant Terms: External Links .  Hoplink Cards : Very simple cards that contain a brief snippet of text that  say something like:   For more on x concept, see cardlink   ‘ xxxx/xx/x ’. These  cards enable one to quickly hop to other relevant places in the Antinet.  Index : A box within the Antinet containing keyterms and corresponding
591 G LOSSARY     cardlinks in the Antinet.   Variant Terms: Index Box, The Index, Register,  Keyword Register .  Indexcards : Notecards placed in the index, which enable you to  navigate to different areas of the Antinet (by way of cardlinks and a  human-readable keyterm).  Keyterm :A human-readable concept that points you to a numeric-alpha  address (cardlink) in the main box of your Antinet.  Keyterm Indexcards : A keyterm indexcard, as opposed to a list index -  card, is a dedicated card listing multiple links or external references for a  given keyterm. Whenever a keyterm entry in a list indexcard accumulates  multiple cardlinks, you’ll want to create a dedicated keyterm indexcard  for it.  List Indexcards : Indexcards filed alphabetically, each pertaining to one letter  of the alphabet ( A ,   B ,   C , etc.). Under the assigned alphabetical character is  a list of keyterms that begin with the letter affixed to the card.  Main Box : The main part of your Antinet containing the main types of  notecards with numeric-alpha addresses affixed to them. These cards follow  the tree-like branching structure of the Antinet.  Maincards (“Cards”) : The main types of notecards stored in your Antinet  (in the main box). Maincards are 4 x 6 inch (or   a 6) horizontal notecards  (preferentially white and blank). They contain a numeric-alpha card address  affixed to the top-left, or top-right, of the notecard. Maincards contain one  of the four types of main notes.   Variant terms: Cards, Notecards .  Main Notes : The types of notes you’ll find on maincards. These four  note types are observation notes, excerpt notes, reformulation notes, and  reflection notes.  Neuroimprinting : The concept of more effectively stamping an idea onto  your mind for later recall done by way of writing by hand.
592      ANTINET ZETTELKASTEN  Personal Knowledge Management (“PKM”) : A   Personal Information  Storage System   used by digital apps, which enables one to link documents  (of typically low-processed information). Otherwise known as a procras -  tinator’s wet dream.  Remotelinks : Say you’re writing a note within the card 4214/5 a /2 and you  create a link to the card 1334/2 a /4. What you have just created is a   remotelink .  You’re linking to a remote area of a card in your tree of knowledge (your  Antinet). Remotelinks are essentially the full card address of another card  that reside in a more remote part of your Antinet (relative to the location  of the card referencing it).  “See Also” Cardlinks : Oftentimes, you don’t need to create a dedicated  hoplink card to navigate around your Antinet. You can just append relevant  cardlinks to already developed cards. This is where “ See Also ”   Cardlinks  come in handy. These are snippets of text at the bottom of cards that say  something like,   See also:   “ xxxx/xx/x. ”  Wikilinks : Cheaply created digital links to other notes (usually markdown  files). Wikilinks are typically created with text enclosed in two square brackets  (e.g., [[I’m a Useless Link to a Digital Note]]).
593  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  Special thanks to the following   people who helped me make this  book a reality: First and foremost, thank you to my lovely fiancé, Arianna  Zabriskie-Scheper. The diagrams in this book were hand-drawn by her (you  can blame her for the illustrations containing the man with a man-bun).  My copyeditor, Wendy Smyer Yu (aka, “Wendy The Wonderful”). My writ -  ing coach, Ross Hartmann, who I worked with only briefly, yet he had a big  impact in getting me started on the actual writing process. Thank you to Chris  Aldrich, who reviewed the   Preface , and provided other invaluable feedback.  Chris is an infinite well of knowledge when it comes to the history of analog  notetaking systems. He is also less of a knucklehead than Moe, Larry, and  Curly. Last, but not least, I would like to thank all of my Antinetters who  supported me (by way of my YouTube channel and Reddit and my private  email list). Also a very special thank you is deserved for my Antinetters who  wrote to me by physical mail very early on in this process. This book is for  those who are committed to growth and learning.

595  ABOUT THE AUTHOR  Scott p. scheper , aka “ The Analog Knowledge Revolutionary ,” is a writer,  copywriter and marketer residing in San Diego, California. When not com -  municating with his Antinet (“Stewie”), one may find Scott communicating  with an actual human being. Actually, probably not. One is more likely to  find Scott reading a book with a bibcard sticking out of it.
